However, Industry Members may submit to the CAT events related to orders received or originated prior to the required reporting date and they will not be rejected.For Phase 2a/2b reporting, if an Industry member chooses to optionally report subsequent events related to such orders, theorderKeyDatefield must be populated with a date prior to the date on which the Industry Member is required to begin reporting to CAT, and the Industry Member will receive a warning that the Order Key references a date prior to CAT go-live. If the Industry Member populates theorderKeyDatefield with a date on or after the date on which the Industry Member is required to begin reporting to CAT, the Industry Member will receive an error that the Order Key is not found.For Phase 2a/2b reporting, if the sending firm chooses not to report the activity, but the receiving firm reports an MEOA to CAT, both parties will receive a linkage error as the CAT Plan Processor would have no way to distinguish that the original order was received by the receiving firm prior to CAT go-live. In this case, both parties that received an error should contact the FINRA CAT Help Desk. Industry Members should note that this issue will only impact CAT Reportable Events for orders received prior to the start of CAT reporting (June 22, 2020 for equities and July 20, 2020 for simple electronic options), which are routed on or after the date when interfirm linkage processing becomes effective (July 27, 2020 in Industry Test Environment and August 10, 2020 in the Production Environment).Starting in Phase 2c, for orders that originated/generated prior to April 26, 2021 and that remain open on April 26, 2021, Industry Members would be required to report any subsequent events in accordance with applicable Phase 2c reporting requirements. For example, if a trailing stop order received on March 3, 2021 remains open on April 26, 2021, then the Industry Member would be required to report an Order Effective event when all underlying conditions are met (e.g., the trailing stop is triggered) in accordance with Phase 2c requirements instead of via an Order Modified event (MEOM), as was required in Phase 2a. (See FAQ B62 for information related to the reporting requirements for Trailing Stop and Trailing Stop Limit orders.)Starting in Phase 2d, for orders that originated/generated prior to December 13, 2021 and that remain open on December 13, 2021, Industry Members would be required to report any subsequent events in accordance with applicable Phase 2d reporting requirements. For example, on December 14, 2021, a customer requests a modification or cancellation to a GTC order that was originally generated on October 5, 2021. In this example, the Industry Member must also capture the time that the cancellation or modification request was received from the customer either in therequestTimestampfield in the Order Modified event (MEOM) or Order Cancelled event (MEOC), as applicable, or in separate Order Modification Request event (MEOMR) or Order Cancel Request event (MEOCR), as outlined in the Reporting Technical Specifications for Industry Members document.For orders that remain open on or after December 13, 2021, and that were not required to be reported prior to Phase 2d, then the subsequent events associated with such orders are not required to be reported if the primary event(s) associated with such activity was not reportable prior to Phase 2d. The Industry Member may choose to optionally report such secondary events to the CAT, but must populate theorderKeyDatefield with a date prior to December 13, 2021, and the Industry Member will receive a warning that the Order Key references a date prior to CAT go-live.

Had total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to § 240.17a-5(d) or, if not required to file such statements, a broker or dealer that had total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last business day of the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and2. Is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization as defined in this section.Rule 0-10(i) under the Exchange Act further states that[f]or purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, a broker or dealer is affiliated with another person if:1. Such broker or dealer controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such other person; a person shall be deemed to control another person if that person has the right to vote 25 percent or more of the voting securities of such other person or is entitled to receive 25 percent or more of the net profits of such other person or is otherwise able to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of such other person; or2. Such broker or dealer introduces transactions in securities, other than registered investment company securities or interests or participations in insurance company separate accounts, to such other person, or introduces accounts of customers or other brokers or dealers, other than accounts that hold only registered investment company securities or interests or participations in insurance company separate accounts, to such other person that carries such accounts on a fully disclosed basis.",

Accordingly, any response to an RFQ or other form of solicitation response provided in a standard electronic format (i.e. FIX) that meets this definition would be reportable starting in Phase 2c for equities and Phase 2d for options.Responses communicated in standard electronic format are reportable by both the CAT Reporter issuing the RFQ or solicitation (solicitor) and the CAT Reporter responding to the RFQ or solicitation (responder). Specifically, the solicitor must report the receipt of all responses, even those that were not ultimately selected.It is important to note that regardless of the form (electronic or manual) of any RFQ or solicitation response, all orders received or originated as the result of such RFQ or solicitation process must be reported as set forth in the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for Industry Members. For equities, both manual and electronic orders must be reported starting in Phase 2a. For options, simple, electronic orders must be reported starting in Phase 2b and all other orders, including manual, complex and paired orders, are reportable starting in Phase 2d.Example 1:A CAT Reporter issues an RFQ through a 3rd party vendor RFQ platform not operated by a broker-dealer. In response to the RFQ, multiple CAT Reporters respond by sending FIX messages directly to the requesting CAT Reporter. Upon selection of a response (either by the trader or automatically by the firm’s trading system), the FIX order from the winning bidder is executed (manually or electronically) OR is routed (manually or electronically) to another broker-dealer or exchange for execution without any further action required by the winning bidder.The electronically provided responses are reportable by all bidders, even those that were not selected, starting in Phase 2c for equities and Phase 2d for options. Further, the CAT Reporter that issued the RFQ would report the receipt of all responses, as well as any subsequent actions taken to process the order starting in Phase 2a for equities, Phase 2b for simple, electronic orders and Phase 2d for all other options orders.Example 2:A CAT Reporter issues an RFQ and receives several quotes in response through a 3rd party vendor RFQ platform not operated by a broker-dealer. Upon selection of a response, the CAT Reporter either:initiates and routes an order electronically to the winning bidder,the RFQ platform automatically sends a routed order to the winning bidder, orthe winning bidder has standing instructions to create a new order acceptance once it receives a message from the RFQ platform that it has won.Because the RFQ responses were sent through an RFQ platform and not via standard electronic format directly to the solicitor/CAT Reporter, none of the responses are reportable in 2c.However, the origination of the new order by the solicitor/CAT Reporter, the route of that new order to the winning bidder, and the acceptance of that order by the winning bidder are all reportable events in the phase that order would otherwise become reportable. The solicitor/CAT Reporter would report the new order and route events; the winning bidder would report the order acceptance, as well as any subsequent actions taken to process the order.Example 3A CAT Reporter issues an RFQ through a 3rd party vendor RFQ platform not operated by a broker-dealer. In response to the RFQ, multiple CAT Reporters respond by sending FIX messages directly to the requesting CAT Reporter’s OMS. Upon selection of a response, the solicitor CAT Reporter either:initiates and routes an order electronically to the winning bidder,the RFQ platform automatically sends a routed order to the winning bidder, orthe winning bidder has standing instructions to create a new order acceptance once it receives a message from the RFQ platform that it has won.Although the RFQ responses were sent via standard electronic format directly to the solicitor/CAT Reporter’s OMS/EMS, the responses are not reportable in Phase 2c because the CAT Reporters sending the responses would be required to take additional action by accepting a separate order from the requestor before any execution can occur, and would therefore not be considered immediately actionable.However, the origination of the new order by the solicitor/CAT Reporter, the route of that new order to the winning bidder, and the acceptance of that order by the winning bidder are all reportable events in the phase that order would otherwise become reportable. The solicitor/CAT Reporter would report the new order and route events; the winning bidder would report the order acceptance, as well as any subsequent actions taken to process the order.Example 4An Asset Manager (non-CAT Reporter) issues and receives several quotes in response through a 3rd party vendor RFQ platform that is not part of any CAT Reporter’s OMS/EMS.

The FINRA Facility allows for corrections of trade reports without cancelling the original trade report and links the corrected trade report by reference to the original trade report. The Industry Member corrects the trade report to 1,000 shares without cancelling the original trade report and the Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number on the corrected trade report remains the same as the Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number on the original trade report.In this scenario, the Industry Member is only required to report a single MEOT linking to the original trade report because the data in the MEOT was correct and it will link to the original trade report which will link by reference to the new trade report.Scenario 2: An Industry Member executes a trade for 1,000 shares and correctly reports the MEOT to CAT for 1,000 shares but incorrectly reports the trade to a FINRA Facility for 100 shares. The FINRA Facility does not allow for corrections of trade reports so the Industry Member must cancel the original trade report and enter a new one. The Industry Member enters the same Branch Sequence Number on the corrected trade report as was on the original (cancelled) trade report.In this scenario, the Industry Member is only required to report a single MEOT because the data in the MEOT was correct and it will link to both the original (cancelled) trade report and the new trade report via thetapeTradeID/Branch Sequence Number since the Industry Member entered the same Branch Sequence Number on the corrected trade report as was on the original (cancelled) trade report.Scenario 3: At 10 am, an Industry Member executes a trade at 9.99 and reports the MEOT to CAT with a price of 9.99. At 10:01 am, the Industry Member then realizes that the trade should have been executed at 9.98 so it cancels the original trade report and enters a new trade report at 9.98 and execution time of 10:01 am.In this scenario, the Industry Member is required to report two MEOTs- one linking to the original (cancelled) trade report and a second linking to the new trade report. Otherwise, the Industry Member will receive trade linkage errors.Scenario 4: An Industry Member executes a trade for 1,000 shares but incorrectly reports the MEOT to CAT for 100 shares and incorrectly reports the trade to a FINRA Facility for 100 shares. The FINRA Facility allows for corrections of trade reports without cancelling the original trade report and links the corrected trade report by reference to the original trade report. The Industry Member corrects the trade report to 1,000 shares without cancelling the original trade report and the Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number on the corrected trade report remains the same as the Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number on the original trade report.In this scenario, the Industry Member is required to link the MEOT for 100 shares to the original trade report for 100 shares and then submit a correction (actionType= ‘COR’) of the MEOT to correct the share quantity to 1,000 shares. The ‘COR’ MEOT will link to both the original trade report and the corrected trade report via thetapeTradeID/Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number since the Industry Member entered the same Branch Sequence Number on the corrected trade report as was on the original (cancelled) trade report.",

If the Industry Member does not reprice a peg order when the market moves, the Industry Member does not need to report a modification of the peg order to the CAT since the order was not modified by either the customer or the Industry Member. For example, for both displayed and non-displayed alternative trading systems (ATSs), if an ATS’s matching engine reprices a peg order when the market moves, the price modification must be reported to the CAT. If a matching engine does not reprice a peg order when the market moves, there is no requirement to report a price modification to the CAT.Example 1: A display ATS receives a buy order with a primary peg instruction and a limit price of $10. The current market is 9.98 and accordingly, the order is displayed at 9.98. The NBB subsequently moves to 9.99. The ATS reprices the order and re-displays it at 9.99. The re-pricing of this order must be reported to CAT by the ATS.Example 2: An ATS receives a buy order with a primary peg instruction and a limit price of $10. The order is not displayable or routable and the ATS has no sell orders that are eligible to trade with the buy order. The NBB subsequently moves to 9.99 and the ATS receives no other sell orders that are eligible to trade with the buy order. The ATS takes no action on the open buy order when the NBB moves to 9.99, therefore there is no CAT reportable event.Example 3: An ATS receives a buy order with mid-point peg instruction when the NBBO is 9.85 x 10. The order is not displayable or routable and the ATS has no sell orders that are eligible to trade with the buy order. The NBBO subsequently moves to 9.90 x 10. The ATS then receives a market order to sell that is eligible to trade with the buy order and the two orders are crossed at 9.95. Because the ATS did not re-price the buy order prior to executing it, there is no CAT reportable event required to reflect a price modification of the buy order to 9.95.",

If an Industry Member has given instructions for such a strategy and no further action is required on the Industry Member’s part to generate an order for a particular component security, the Industry Member is required to report a new order event (MONO or MENO) and an order route event (MOOR or MEOR) for each component security included in the strategy as eligible to trade, even though all the material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time. The Industry Member receiving such instructions is required to report order accepted events for each component security included in the strategy, again, even though all the material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time. Although all material terms may not be known, both Industry Members are to report those material terms discernable from the strategy instructions.Example 1Broker 1 uses a Vega algorithm provided by Broker 2 and within Broker 2’s system stipulates a list of 10 option series that are eligible for Broker 2 to generate orders to trade on Broker 1’s behalf. No further action is required on Broker 1’s part to generate any order for a particular series. Broker 1 would report a MONO and a MOOR for each option series provided in the list of eligible securities within the algorithmic parameters, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time.Broker 2 will report a corresponding order accepted event (MOOA) for each of the 10 option series provided as eligible component securities, again, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time.Each order event above must be marked as follows:FieldValueQuantityMaximum Quantity if specified on the algo parameters; or Zero quantity (if no maximum quantity is explicitly specified) indicates that there is no set quantity stipulatedpriceTypeLimitPrice0handlingInstructions‘ALGS’ indicates that the event is part of an algorithmic strategy where the specific quantity may not be explicitly providedWhen Broker 2’s algorithm generates specific orders for any of the eligible securities and routes those orders to an exchange or another Industry Member, Broker 2 must report an order route event (MOOR) related to the order accepted event (MOOA) for the specific eligible security reported to reflect receipt of the order from Broker 1.If Broker 2’s algorithm does not ultimately generate any specific order(s) in an eligible option series, no further reporting is required by either Broker 1 or Broker 2 for that series. If Broker 1 or Broker 2 cancels or modifies the trading instruction, then a cancel or modify event would be required for each applicable component option series following existing guidance for the reporting of cancel events.Example 2A non-broker-dealer customer uses a Vega algorithm provided by Broker 2 and within Broker 2’s system stipulates a list of 10 option series that are eligible for Broker 2 to generate orders to trade on the non-broker-dealer customer’s behalf. No further action is required on the customer’s part to generate any order for a particular series. Broker 2 would report a MONO for each option series provided in the list of eligible securities within the algorithmic parameters, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time. The MONO event must be marked as noted in the table above.When Broker 2’s algorithm generates specific orders for any of the eligible securities and routes those orders to an exchange or another Industry Member, Broker 2 must report an order route event (MOOR) related to the new order event (MONO) for the specific eligible security reported to reflect receipt of the order from the non-broker-dealer customer.If Broker 2’s algorithm does not ultimately generate any specific order(s) in an eligible option series, no further reporting is required by Broker 2 for that series.

Although all material terms may not be known, both Industry Members are to report those material terms discernable from the strategy instructions.Example 1Broker 1 uses a Vega algorithm provided by Broker 2 and within Broker 2’s system stipulates a list of 10 option series that are eligible for Broker 2 to generate orders to trade on Broker 1’s behalf. No further action is required on Broker 1’s part to generate any order for a particular series. Broker 1 would report a MONO and a MOOR for each option series provided in the list of eligible securities within the algorithmic parameters, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time.Broker 2 will report a corresponding order accepted event (MOOA) for each of the 10 option series provided as eligible component securities, again, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time.Each order event above must be marked as follows:FieldValueQuantityMaximum Quantity if specified on the algo parameters; or Zero quantity (if no maximum quantity is explicitly specified) indicates that there is no set quantity stipulatedpriceTypeLimitPrice0handlingInstructions‘ALGS’ indicates that the event is part of an algorithmic strategy where the specific quantity may not be explicitly providedWhen Broker 2’s algorithm generates specific orders for any of the eligible securities and routes those orders to an exchange or another Industry Member, Broker 2 must report an order route event (MOOR) related to the order accepted event (MOOA) for the specific eligible security reported to reflect receipt of the order from Broker 1.If Broker 2’s algorithm does not ultimately generate any specific order(s) in an eligible option series, no further reporting is required by either Broker 1 or Broker 2 for that series. If Broker 1 or Broker 2 cancels or modifies the trading instruction, then a cancel or modify event would be required for each applicable component option series following existing guidance for the reporting of cancel events.Example 2A non-broker-dealer customer uses a Vega algorithm provided by Broker 2 and within Broker 2’s system stipulates a list of 10 option series that are eligible for Broker 2 to generate orders to trade on the non-broker-dealer customer’s behalf. No further action is required on the customer’s part to generate any order for a particular series. Broker 2 would report a MONO for each option series provided in the list of eligible securities within the algorithmic parameters, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time. The MONO event must be marked as noted in the table above.When Broker 2’s algorithm generates specific orders for any of the eligible securities and routes those orders to an exchange or another Industry Member, Broker 2 must report an order route event (MOOR) related to the new order event (MONO) for the specific eligible security reported to reflect receipt of the order from the non-broker-dealer customer.If Broker 2’s algorithm does not ultimately generate any specific order(s) in an eligible option series, no further reporting is required by Broker 2 for that series. If the non-broker-dealer customer or Broker 2 cancels or modifies the trading instruction, then a cancel or modify event would be required for each applicable component option series following existing guidance for the reporting of cancel events.At this time, the above-described algorithmic strategy trading instructions are reportable to CAT. Should the Participants determine in the future that such instructions are not reportable to CAT, the reporting guidance may change.",

Generally, Floor Brokers on both the equities and options trading floors receive orders from one of several sources and such orders are processed via an order management system (“OMS”) before they are entered into an exchange for execution. For example, Floor Brokers may receive an order from within their own firm, which has electronically routed the order from one of its internal systems into the Floor Broker’s OMS. For CAT reporting purposes, that transfer of an order from the firm’s own internal system to that firm’s Floor Broker OMS on the floor of the NYSE is likely CAT reportable as an intrafirm transfer/internal route as described in the Tech Specs and required by Rule 613(c)(7)(ii)(F) and Rule 613(c)(7)(iii). In another scenario, Floor Brokers may receive an order from an outside source and enter it into the firm’s Floor Broker OMS. In this scenario, the Floor Broker must record and report the time of the order receipt as described in SEC Rule 613(c)(7)(i)(E), Appendix C at section A(1)(a)(iii) of the CAT NMS Plan and also described in the Tech Specs.After a Floor Broker receives the order and the order is in the Floor Broker’s OMS, the Floor Broker determines how to represent their order. A Floor Broker may, for example: 1) send the order back to the source if routed directly to the Floor Broker’s OMS by another desk within the Floor Broker’s firm; 2) electronically send the order directly to an exchange system for execution; 3) electronically route the order to a third-party provider that determines where to route the order (to an exchange or other execution venue); or 4) orally represent and then execute the order on the floor. Each of these scenarios may include events that trigger an obligation to report to CAT.In the first three scenarios, electronically routing an order from the Floor Broker’s OMS to another of the Floor Broker firm’s internal systems, to an exchange, or to a third-party provider constitutes a CAT-reportable event pursuant to Rule 613(c)(7)(ii).

Given the purpose of the FDID under the CAT NMS Plan, it is important that this identifier be unique, persistent and consistent within the firm and across all vendors and systems the Industry Member may use to report Transaction Order events requiring an FDID to CAT and associated Customer and Account information for the FDID to CAT CAIS, and unique across time.A change/replacement in the FDID value associated with a particular trading account would be an isolated event that is only permissible in certain limited circumstances, such as:System migration.For example, Industry Member 1 changes from System A to System B, which necessitates the generation of unique FDID values for accounts, and the system migration does not involve closing the underlying accounts.Change of vendors.For example, an Industry Member currently uses an Order Management System (“OMS”) provided by Vendor A but will change to Vendor B’s OMS. Vendor B’s OMS does not support some of the characters supported by Vendor A so the Industry Member must change the FDID. Please see FAQs B53 and Q53.Change in Clearing Firm.For example, an Industry Member changes from Clearing Firm A to Clearing Firm B. Clearing Firm B does not permit FDIDs in the same format as Clearing Firm A so the Industry Member must change the FDID.Change in masking methodology.Changing the algorithm which creates a new FDID value for the accountMasking a previously unmasked FDID valueOnly for proprietary accounts:unmasking a masked FDID value of a proprietary account.Note that the above limited circumstances do not include correcting an erroneously reported FDID, closing an account, or transferring the FDID to another CAT Reporter Firm. Please see theCAT Reporting Customer and Account Technical Specifications for Industry Membersfor more information on these scenarios.Also, please see FAQ M16 for the requirements when replacing/changing an FDID.The same guidance outlined above would apply to an FDID value representing a Relationship Identifier (“Relationship ID”).",

                  "text": "Firm Designated ID (FDID) is defined in Section 1.1 of the CAT NMS Plan as “(1) a unique and persistent identifier for each trading account designated by Industry Members for purposes of providing data to the Central Repository, provided, however, such identifier may not be the account number for such trading account if the trading account is not a proprietary account; (2) a unique and persistent relationship identifier when an Industry Member does not have an account number available to its order handling and/or execution system at the time of order receipt, provided, however, such identifier must be masked; or (3) a unique and persistent entity identifier when an employee of an Industry Member is exercising discretion over multiple client accounts and creates an aggregated order for which a trading account number of the Industry Member is not available at the time of order origination, where each such identifier is unique among all identifiers from any given Industry Member.” Under the CAT NMS Plan, broker-dealers are required to report the FDID on all Transaction Order events requiring the FDID submitted to the Central Repository and the Central Repository will associate specific customers and their CAT Customer IDs (CCID) with individual order events based on the reported FDID. Given the purpose of the FDID under the CAT NMS Plan, it is important that this identifier be unique, persistent and consistent within the firm and across all vendors and systems the Industry Member may use to report Transaction Order events requiring an FDID to CAT and associated Customer and Account information for the FDID to CAT CAIS, and unique across time.A change/replacement in the FDID value associated with a particular trading account would be an isolated event that is only permissible in certain limited circumstances, such as:System migration.For example, Industry Member 1 changes from System A to System B, which necessitates the generation of unique FDID values for accounts, and the system migration does not involve closing the underlying accounts.Change of vendors.For example, an Industry Member currently uses an Order Management System (“OMS”) provided by Vendor A but will change to Vendor B’s OMS. Vendor B’s OMS does not support some of the characters supported by Vendor A so the Industry Member must change the FDID. Please see FAQs B53 and Q53.Change in Clearing Firm.For example, an Industry Member changes from Clearing Firm A to Clearing Firm B. Clearing Firm B does not permit FDIDs in the same format as Clearing Firm A so the Industry Member must change the FDID.Change in masking methodology.Changing the algorithm which creates a new FDID value for the accountMasking a previously unmasked FDID valueOnly for proprietary accounts:unmasking a masked FDID value of a proprietary account.Note that the above limited circumstances do not include correcting an erroneously reported FDID, closing an account, or transferring the FDID to another CAT Reporter Firm. Please see theCAT Reporting Customer and Account Technical Specifications for Industry Membersfor more information on these scenarios.Also, please see FAQ M16 for the requirements when replacing/changing an FDID.The same guidance outlined above would apply to an FDID value representing a Relationship Identifier (“Relationship ID”).",

The Reporter Portal will also be available over the MNSP connection(s). Alternatively the Industry Members may access the Reporter Portal via a browser based Remote Client VPN connection that will also be made available to Industry Members. All Industry Members must have access to the SFTP and CAT Reporter Portal in order to report and receive information about file and record rejections, statistics about order reporting, and announcements. In order to use SFTP and CAT Reporter Portal, Industry Members must register with CAT prior to the beginning of Phase 2a. If an Industry Member is using one or more third parties for reporting, it must work closely with those organizations in the CAT testing environment to resolve any issues before it begins reporting to the CAT production environment. More details regarding the MNSP and VPN access methods will be published in July once the MNSP vendor(s) is selected. For additional information, refer to the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for Industry Members.",

Further, FAQ Q44 states that in instances where an Industry Member maintains separate addresses at the account and customer level, then all such reasonably available addresses must be reported to CAIS.While various addresses associated with a particular Account or Customer are of regulatory significance, the Plan Participants recognize that Industry Members may save several addresses in their records, some of which may contain legacy information. The requirement to report additional address information maintained by the Industry Member is not intended to change or supersede the Industry Members’ obligations to collect or maintain customer and account address information. Outside of Industry Members’ existing record keeping requirements and applicable SRO and SEC rules, there are no additional CAT CAIS-specific requirements to validate, audit or otherwise update and maintain such additional addresses by or at the time they are initially reported to CAT CAIS along with the full set of Customer and Account information with the implementation of Phase 2e (Full CAIS).

In this example, the CAT Reporter firm would generate the TID value from the SSN.In the event the CAT Customer does not have a US-assigned Input Identifier but has more than one foreign Input Identifier of a specific type– such as multiple Tax Identifiers or multiple Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) values – then the CAT Reporter Firm must determine which value is the primary, current value. If multiple values are current, the CAT Reporter firm must select the Input Identifier from the country/municipality of the primary incorporation or residence of the customer.For example, a Legal Entity CAT Customer is currently legally registered in both the United Kingdom and France, and provides the CAT Reporter with a Tax Identifier for both locations. The Customer indicates and/or the CAT Reporter ascertains that the United Kingdom is the primary incorporation of the Legal Entity.  In this example, the CAT Reporter would use the Tax Identifier for the United Kingdom to generate the TID value.",

There currently is no exemptive relief that would allow only the submission of an incomplete Customer Record for a Natural Person Authorized Trader. Use of the Authorized Trader Names List rather than the submission of all information required for Natural Person Authorized Traders could be subject to review by Regulators. Accordingly, Industry Members are encouraged to report all data required for Natural Person Authorized Traders as soon as possible before the Full CAIS Compliance Go-Live date.The requirement to report to CAT CAIS afirstName,lastName,yearOfBirth,tidTypeandtidValue(i.e., a hashed version of an Input Identifier, such as a social security number) for all Natural Person Authorized Traders means that CAT may impose new recording and reporting obligations on some Industry Members with respect to obtaining Customer information to meet their CAT reporting obligations. Some Industry Members may have to change current onboarding activities to ensure Customer information is obtained and recorded for any Active Accounts with CAT Reportable Events, including for accounts that existed prior to the effective date of the CAT NMS Plan.",

The CCID strategy uses a two-phase transformation that avoids the receipt or retention of social security numbers or individual taxpayer identification numbers in the CAT. Industry Members will not receive the generated CCID. The resultant CCID and an associated Firm Designated ID (“FDID”) will be stored by the Plan Processor for further processing. As noted above, the Participants requested an exemption from the SEC from certain provisions of the CAT NMS Plan so that the dates of birth and account numbers of individual customers would not be reported to the CAT Central Repository.

In this example, since the clearing firm knows it is allocating shares to an average price account that is owned/controlled by its IB, the clearing firm must populate theaccountHolderTypefield with ‘V’ (Firm agency average price account) indicating that the average price account is owned/controlled by the IB.Example 2 (Allocation report NOT required but may be voluntarily reported)An executing self-clearing firm receives an order from another broker-dealer. The order is executed, and the shares are booked into an account that is owned or controlled by the other broker-dealer before allocation to the final customer accounts.",

Accordingly, each Prospective CAT Fee will remain in place until a new Prospective CAT Fee is in effect, thereby ensuring continuous funding for the CAT. Thus, once CAT Fee 2024-1 is in effect, it is expected that there will be a Prospective CAT Fee continuously in effect going forward, with the fee rate being updated twice a year.For example, it is intended that the last invoice for CAT Fee 2024-1 will be provided to CAT Executing Brokers in January 2025.  The Operating Committee is then required to calculate a new fee rate for a new Prospective CAT Fee at the beginning of 2025. Once the Operating Committee has approved the new fee rate for the beginning of 2025, each of the Participants will be required to file fee filings to implement the next Prospective CAT Fee based on the new Fee Rate (i.e., CAT Fee 2025-1).  If CAT Fee 2025-1 is in effect by February 2025, then the last invoice for CAT Fee 2024-1 will be sent in January 2025, and the first invoice for CAT Fee 2025-1 would be sent in February 2025.However, if CAT Fee 2025-1 does not become effective by February 2025 (e.g., if the SEC temporarily suspends the filing for CAT Fee 2025-1), then CAT Fee 2024-1 will remain in effect until a new Prospective CAT Fee is in effect. CAT LLC will provide notice when CAT Fee 2024-1 will no longer be in effect.The process for implementing a new Prospective CAT Fee at the beginning of the year will be repeated again mid-year. Updating the fee rate twice a year is intended to keep the Prospective CAT Fees closely tied to the CAT costs. For example, the Operating Committee would be required to calculate a new fee rate for the Prospective CAT Fee mid-year. Once the Operating Committee has approved the new fee rate mid-year, each of the Participants will be required to file fee filings for the new Prospective CAT Fee based on such fee rate (i.e., CAT Fee 2025-2).  Once CAT Fee 2025-2 is in effect, it would replace CAT Fee 2025-1.This process would then repeat each year.",
