The SEC \napproved the CAT NMS Plan on November 15, 2016. \nIn accordance with SEC Rule 613, the CAT NMS Plan requires a Central Repository that will \ncomprehensively track orders throughout their lifecycle and identify the Participants and Industry \nMembers handling them, as well as the account holders and authorized traders for any account that \noriginates an order (Customers3). Specific data elements will be submitted to the Central Repository by \nParticipants, Industry Members, and CAT Reporting Agents. CAT Reporting Agents may be third- party \nfirms reporting on behalf of other entities, or may be outside parties that are not required to submit data to \nthe CAT, but from which the CAT may receive data per the CAT NMS Plan, such as the Securities \nInformation Processors (SIPs). \nThe CAT NMS Plan also requires the selection of an entity as the Plan Processor to be responsible for \nperforming the processing functions required by Rule 613 and the Plan. The Operating Committee of \nConsolidated Audit Trail, LLC, a governing body composed of representatives of the Participants, \noversees the operation of the CAT. The duties of the Operating Committee are further described in Article \nIV of the CAT NMS Plan. \nRefer to SEC Rule 613, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34- 67457.pdf for more details. \nRefer also to CAT NMS Plan, available at: https://www.catnmsplan.com/about-cat/cat-nms-plan.  \n \n \n3 Customers are defined in SEC Rule 613(j)(3) as: (i) the account holder(s) of the account at a registered broker-dealer originating \nthe order; and (ii) any person from whom the broker-dealer is authorized to accept trading instructions for such account, if \ndifferent from the account holder(s).     \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  2"

A \nCAT Reporter may use any SRO-assigned identifier that is valid on the CAT Trading Day for which CAT \nevents are submitted. CAT will use reference data submitted by Participant Reporters each day to identify \nthe Industry Member to which the specific identifier is assigned. Each SRO-assigned identifier is linked to \nthe Industry Member's CRD number so that all reporting activity of a single Industry Member CAT reporter \ncan be consolidated at the firm level in CAT. Refer to Section 2.4.1.1 for additional information on \npopulating the CAT Reporter IMID. \nCAT Submitter ID \nThe CAT Submitter ID is a CAT assigned identifier for a firm that submits data to CAT. The Submitter ID \nuniquely identifies the Submitter and is not the same identifier as the CAT Reporter IMID. CAT Reporters \nmay submit data for themselves or may authorize a Reporting Agent to report on the CAT Reporter\u2019s \nbehalf.  \nAuthorization between CAT Reporters, Submitter and CAT Reporting Agents is granted through a \nreporting relationship that will be entered by the CAT Reporter using the CAT Reporter Portal.

The CATReporterIMID is populated with the SRO-\nassigned identifier used to report to CAT. The CATReporterIMID is used to consolidate activity occurring \nboth within the CATReporterIMID and at the firm (CRD) level. It also participates in the Linkage Keys \nused for Intrafirm Linkage and TRF Linkage. The CATReporterIMID does not participate in the Linkage \nKeys for Interfirm Linkage.      \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  7 \nThe CATReporterIMID is populated with the SRO-assigned identifier used to report to CAT according to \nthe following requirements: \n1. FINRA members must populate the CAT Reporter IMID with the same MPID that it uses for related \ntrade reporting facility (TRF) trade reporting, or, for quoting on an interdealer quotation system.  \n2. FINRA members that operate an alternative trading system (ATS) must use their FINRA ATS MPID.  \n3. If there is no ATS, TRF or quoting MPID requirement, any valid FINRA MPID may be populated.  \n4. Non-FINRA members may use any effective identifier of the firm as included in the Daily published \nMember Dictionary, as described in the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for Plan Participants .  \n5. When a CAT Reporter routes between different IMIDs of the same firm (same CRD), the CAT \nReporter IMID may not be populated with the same value on the Order Route and Order Accepted \nevents.  \n6. The CATReporterIMID populated in the Data File name and in the CAT event (if populated) must be \nequal, otherwise the record will be rejected.  \n2.4.1.2. IMID on Routing Events in the senderIMID, receiverIMID and destination Fields \nIMIDs are populated in Order Accepted, Order Route, New Quote and Quote Received events with the \nIndustry Member identifier used when routing between venues. This identifier is known to both parties \nand is required to be populated in the senderIMID, receiverIMID and destination fields where applicable.  \nThe IMID participates in the Linkage Keys used for Interfirm Linkage and Exchange Linkage. When the \nsame Industry Member Identifier (IMID) is assigned by different SROs to represent different Industry \nMembers, an IMID conflict is created. To avoid conflicts, to simplify the population of the Industry Member \nIdentifiers, and to streamline linkage processing, CAT reporters must populate the senderIMID, \nreceiverIMID and destination (when routing to an IM) fields with both the CRD and IMID, formatted as \n<CRD of the CAT Reporter>:<IMID of the Industry Member performing the action in the CAT event>. The \nIndustry Member ID must include the identifier that is known by the routing firm and destination venue. \nFor example: CRD 123, IMID ABC is formatted as 123:ABC. \nThe IMID provided in the senderIMID, receiverIMID and destination fields can be different than the CAT \nReporter IMID. For example, CAT Reporter ABCD (CRD 123) may use FRMA as its CAT Reporter IMID, \nbut when routing to Exchange A, it uses the exchange assigned identifier ABC. In this scenario, on its \nOrder Route event, Firm A would populate its identifier in the CAT Reporter IMID field as FRMA and its \nidentifier in the senderIMID field as 123:ABC.      \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  8 \nFor orders received from or routed to an alternative trading system (ATS), the FINRA ATS MPID must be \nused. FINRA members must use the same MPID for CAT reporting that it uses for related trade reporting \nfacility (TRF) trade reporting, or, for quoting on an interdealer quotation system. If there is no ATS, TRF or \nquoting MPID requirement, firms may agree to use any valid FINRA MPID when routing to or receiving \nfrom another FINRA member, as long as both CAT Reporters use the same MPID as the IMID. Routing \nidentifiers representing FINRA members are populated as: <FINRA Member CRD>:<FINRA Member \nMPID>. \nFor orders received from or routed to a non-FINRA member firm, firms must agree to use the same IMID \nwhen reporting events to CAT. Non-FINRA members may use any effective identifier of the firm. Routing \nidentifiers representing non-FINRA members are populated as: <non-FINRA Member CRD>:<non-FINRA \nMember MPID>. \nFor orders routed to or received from an exchange, CAT reporters must populate the IMID with both the \nCRD and exchange assigned identifier used in the order route message to the exchange, formatted as \n<CRD>:<exchange assigned identifier>. \nRefer to Section 2.6.3.1 for additional information on how IMIDs participate in linkage."

After the reporting of Full Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying \nInformation begins, FDIDs will be used to link accounts to specific customers, including mapping \naccounts with common ownership (for instance, where a customer is associated with more than one \nFDID). Therefore, FDID is required to be populated on all Transaction Order events requiring FDID for \nboth equities and options. \nIndustry Members must assign a single FDID to each trading account that is unique, persistent and \nconsistent within the firm and across all vendors and systems the Industry Member may use to report \nTransaction Order events requiring an FDID to CAT and associated Customer and Account information \nfor the FDID to CAT CAIS, and unique across time. For example, if an Industry Member uses multiple \nvendors for reporting Transaction data to CAT, the Industry Member must ensure that all vendors use the \nsame FDID for a particular trading account in all CAT Transaction Order events requiring an FDID, and \nthat the same FDID associated with the trading account is submitted to the Customer and Account \nInformation System. \nExamples of what an FDID would represent include: \n\u2022 Individual Customer Account Number  \n\u2022 Institutional Customer Account Number      \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  10 \n\u2022 Account Number of Average Price Account Designated for a Specific Customer (e.g., Master \nAccount or agency Representative Order scenarios)  \n\u2022 Account Number of Firm Average Price Account Shared Across Customers (e.g., Master Account, \nAccount Used for Agency Representative Order Flows)  \n\u2022 Proprietary Trading Account Number  \n\u2022 Firm assigned identifier representing a trading relationship (Relationship ID) can be used when \nthe trading account structure is unavailable at the time the order was placed  \n\u2022 Industry Member assigned identifier (Entity ID) representing the Industry Member\u2019s discretionary \nrelationship with the client when an employee of the Industry Member is exercising discretion \nover multiple client accounts and creates an aggregated order for which a trading account \nnumber of the Industry Member is unavailable at the time of order origination  \nAn actual customer account number must not be used as the FDID for a customer account for CAT \nreporting and the same guidance would apply to an FDID representing a Relationship ID . See CAT FAQ \nM2 for more information on the prohibition on use of actual account numbers, and CAT FAQs M10 and \nM14 for more information on masking. Also, refer to the CAT Industry Presentation on FDID for additional \ninformation.  \nA change/replacement in the FDID value associated with a particular trading account, Relationship ID and \nEntity ID would be an isolated event that is only permissible in certain limited circumstances, such as \nsystem migration, change of vendors, change in Clearing Firm and change in masking methodology used \nfor FDID values.

Calculating 97% of 4,555 = 4418.35 which becomes the dollar strike price of the new FLEX \nOption. The final OSI code is issued 4SPXW 230818P04418350. This is a standard 21-character OSI \ncode, which will be used for clearing and settlement, and all future trading of this option series.  \nPosition Length Component Description  Example \n1-6 6 Option Trading \nSymbol \nThe Root Trading Symbol indicating the underlying and \nFLEX terms (FLEX prefix in included in this root symbol). 6-\ncharacter field buffered with trailing spaces. \n4SPXW \n7-12 6 Expiration Date The expiration date of the option in YYMMDD format 230818 = \n08/18/2023 \n13 1 Option Type Call or Put P \n14-18 5 Strike Price Strike Price represented in dollars.

A Boolean attribute is a Name and a \nNon-Boolean attribute is a Name with an accompanying paired Value. \nMultiple attributes are separated by a delimiter. Both Boolean and Non-\nBoolean attributes are case sensitive. Refer to Appendix G: Data Dictionary \n for a list of acceptable Boolean and non-Boolean attributes for the \nhandlingInstructions and timeInForce Name/Value fields. \n \nWhen represented in JSON, the following rules apply: \n\u2022 The OBJECT is contained within curly brackets { }. \n\u2022 Name/Value Pairs are comma separated. \n\u2022 A Value accompanied by a Name must be formatted as per the data \ntype syntax required in JSON.     \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  19 \nData Type JSON Type Description \n\u2022 A Boolean attribute should only include the Name. For example, if a \nhandlingInstructions value of AOK (Auction or Kill) applies to an event, \nthen it should be reported as \"AOK\": true. If AOK is not applicable to an \nevent, then it should not be reported as \"AOK\": false; rather, it should \nnot be reported at all.   \n\u2022 A Name that can contain a list of Values must be formatted as per the \ndata type syntax required in JSON, even when only one value is \npresent in the list.   \n \nFor example, handlingInstructions are represented as follows in JSON:  \n\"handlingInstructions\":{ \n\"AOK\": true, \n\"DISP\": 10.00, \n\"TMO\":\"20190419T092316.123456789\", \n\"AucResp\":\"AuctionID456\" \n\u201cDLVT\u201d:[\u201cMM1\u201d,\u201dMM2\u201d,\u201dMM3\u201d] \n} \n \nWhen represented in CSV, the following rules apply: \n\u2022 The OBJECT is represented in a single position delimited by comma. \n\u2022 Name/Value Pairs are pipe delimited. \n\u2022 A Boolean attribute should only include the Name. For example, if a \nhandlingInstructions value of AOK (Auction or Kill) applies to an event, \nthen it should be reported as AOK and it should NOT be reported as \nAOK=true. Similarly, if AOK is not applicable to an event, then it should \nnot be reported as AOK=false; rather, it should not be reported at all. \n\u2022 A Name with multiple values must include an \u2018@\u2019 delimiter separating \neach Value. \n\u2022 Non-Boolean attributes which require a paired Value will include that \nvalue immediately after the Name and a single equal sign (ASCII \ndecimal 61, hex 3D). \n \nIn CSV, handlingInstructions is represented as:  \nAOK|DISP=10.00|TMO=20190419T092316.123456789|AucResp= \nAuctionID456|DLVT=MM1@MM2@MM3 \n \ntimeInForce is also defined as a Name/Value Pair, however only one \nattribute is applicable. The following examples demonstrate how to \nrepresent in JSON and CSV: \n \nEx JSON CSV \n1 \"timeInForce\":{\"DAY\": \n20190528} \nDAY=20190528 \n2 \"timeInForce\":{\"GTT\": \n\u201c20190528T160000.000000\u201d} \nGTT=20190528T160000.000000 \n3 \u201ctimeInForce\u201d:{\u201cIOC\u201d: true} IOC \nArray ARRAY A list of 0, 1 or more values of the same data type. \nWhen represented in JSON, the following rules apply: \n\u2022 ARRAY is within a set of brackets [ ]     \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  20 \nData Type JSON Type Description \n\u2022 Elements within the array are comma separated.  \nFor example, atsOrderType is represented as the following in JSON: \n\"atsOrderType\":[\"PEG\",\"midPEG\"] \n \nWhen represented in CSV, the following rules apply: \n\u2022 ARRAY is represented in a single position delimited by comma \n\u2022 Elements in the array are pipe delimited \n \nWhen represented in CSV, it is: \n,,,PEG|midPEG,,, \nChoice STRING A Text field with an explicit list of acceptable values. Appendix G: Data \nDictionary lists the acceptable values for each Choice field. \nSymbol STRING Text (22). Refer to Section 2.4.3 and Section 2.4.4 for more details on \nEquity and Options symbols.

        "content": "A Trade Event is used when the Industry Member acts as the executing broker and is required to report \nthe trade for public dissemination purposes. When an Industry Member is not required to report the \nexecution of a customer/client order for public dissemination purposes, with the exceptions noted below, \nan Order Fulfillment event must be used. See Section 4.12 Order Fulfillment for more details. \nReporting Exception Codes \nIn general, Trade events are required to match to a TRF/ORF/ADF report. However, t here are four \ncircumstances when an MEOT would not be able to be linked to a TRF report and a Reporting Exception \nCode (REC) is required on a Trade event to allow the Processor to identify that there will be no link to a \nTRF/ORF/ADF report:     \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  136 \n\u2022 An Industry Member executes a trade between two desks or departments of the same firm, but \nbecause there is no change in beneficial ownership, no trade is reported for public dissemination. \nIn this instance a REC of \u201cP\u201d should be used on the Trade event.  \n\u2022 An Industry Member executes a trade and must report the trade via Form T. In this instance,  a \nREC of \u201cF\u201d should be used on the Trade event. \n\u2022 A trade was executed by a non-FINRA member firm and was reported to the TRF by the FINRA \nmember counterparty. In this instance, the non-FINRA member must populate a REC of \u201cN\u201d on \nthe Trade event. \n\u2022 Industry Member was the contra side of the trade report which was reported to a TRF/ORF/ADF \nvia a QSR or AGU, and was therefore unable to populate a tapeTradeID. In this instance, a REC \nof \u2018C\u2019 should be used on the Trade event to reflect a linkage to the related TRF/ORF/ADF report \ncould not be made. The following rules apply when REC \u2018C\u2019 is used: \n\uf077 The marketCenterID field must be populated. \n\uf077 The clearingFirm and counterparty fields must be populated.  \n\uf077 The cancelFlag and cancelTimestamp must be populated accordingly for all trades that are \nreported to a TRF via a QSR or AGU and later cancelled, as the CAT would not be able to \nlink to a related TRF cancellation. \nFINRA CAT will closely monitor all uses of REC \u2018C\u2019 to ensure compliance with the above noted \nguidelines.  \n \nTrade Side Details \nTrade events are two-sided, containing information on both sides of the trade. Exceptions requiring only \none side of the Trade event to be populated are noted below. The details of each side are reported using \nTrade Side Details. The data type Trade Side Details is described as a list of fields in  Table 49 below. \nTrade Side Details must contain only one orderID per side. The buyDetails must contain the orderID of \nthe buy side of the trade and the sellDetails must contain the orderID of the sell side of the trade. If there \nis more than one orderID associated with one side of the trade, the Trade Side Details related to each \norderID must be populated in a separate Trade Supplement event.  \nInternalized Trade \nWhen an Industry Member internalizes an order by filling it from a proprietary account, the Industry \nMember must report the orderID on the customer/client side and the FDID and the accountHolderType of \nthe proprietary account on the firm side. In this scenario, no orderID is required on the firm side of the \nTrade event. The capacity field on the trade event must be \u2018P\u2019 for Principal reflecting the capacity in which \nthe Industry Member acted.     \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  137 \nHowever, if the Industry Member generates a proprietary order to facilitate the execution of the \ncustomer/client order, the Industry Member must report the orderID of both the customer/client side and \nthe firm side of the Trade event. Refer to CAT FAQ B41 for additional information. \nOne-Sided Trade events \nThere are several exceptions which only require one side of a Trade event to be populated. These \nexceptions include: \n\u2022 Trade is executed as the result of a negotiation between two Industry Members.  \n\u2022 Order is routed by a FINRA Member to a non-FINRA member, and the FINRA Member has the \nobligation to submit a media trade report to a TRF/ADF/ORF.  \n\u2022 Order is routed by an Industry Member to a foreign broker-dealer, and the foreign broker-dealer \nexecutes the order at a net price, creating a media trade reporting obligation in the United States.  \nIn these scenarios, each party that is required to report a Trade event to CAT must populate the \nsideDetailsInd indicating which side of the trade the Industry Member was associated with, and which \nTrade Side Details will be populated in the Trade event. \nCancelled Trades \nIn accordance with CAT FAQ E25, the cancelFlag must be set to true only in instances when a trade is \ncancelled because the trade report is rejected by the TRF/ORF or ADF. For all instances where a trade is \nreported to, and accepted by, the TRF/ORF or ADF, including those that are cancelled or busted in the \ntrade reporting data, the cancelFlag must be set to false. Refer to CAT FAQ E29 and CAT FAQ E30 for \nadditional information."

        "content": "During Linkage Discovery, events are compared with other events to perform duplicate checks, out of \nsequence checks and linkages among events having the same Linkage Keys. The linkage types \nperformed by CAT are defined in Section 2.6. \nLinkage Discovery processing will occur in the following order:  \nTable 157: Steps in Linkage Discovery \nSeq Linkage Discovery Step Feedback \n1 Full Duplicate Checks When duplicates are found, one record is kept and all others are rejected \n2 Order Key, Trade Key, Quote \nKey and Fulfillment Key \nDuplicate Checks \nWhen an Event Key is duplicated, all events having the same key are rejected \n3 Intrafirm Linkage, Out of \nSequence, and FDID \nValidation \nEvents within a firm that do not match or are found to be out of sequence result \nin an unlinked event. Events are sequenced to the maximum timestamp \ngranularity provided in the event. \nAdditionally, events where the FDID provided does not exist in the CAIS data or \nis not valid on the specified date will result in an FDID validation error. Events \nreceiving an FDID validation error will participate in all linkage processing. \nFor RFQ responses that are communicated in standard electronic format directly \nto an Industry Member\u2019s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not \n\u201cimmediately actionable\u201d (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be \nexecuted/routed), ), which are not required to be reported to CAT until August 1, \n2026, Intrafirm Linkage validations are enabled beginning July 29, 2024. \nInterfirm Linkage Events routed/received between firms that do not match result in an unlinked \nevent, including Route Key duplicate checks. \nFor RFQ responses that are communicated in standard electronic format directly \nto an Industry Member\u2019s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not \n\u201cimmediately actionable\u201d (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be \nexecuted/routed), ), which are not required to be reported to CAT until August 1, \n2026, Interfirm Linkage errors validations will be suppressed in scenarios where \na quote event is routed to, or received from, Industry Members. \nExchange Linkage Events routed to an Exchange that do not match result in an unlinked event, \nincluding Route Key duplicate checks \nTrade Linkage Trade events which name a TRF/ORF/ADF record that do not match result in an \nunlinked event \n \nThe following rules apply for Linkage Discovery: \n1. Linkage Discovery processing will be performed for all events which pass Ingestion.  \n2. Linkage feedback files will include the file extension .linkage. \n3. Linkage feedback error files will include the file extension .linkage.error.     \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  343 \n4. Linkage feedback error summary files will include the file extension \n.linkage.error.summary. \n5. A linkage feedback error summary file is provided when one or more FDID validation errors exist \nfor a processing date. \n6. The CATReporterIMID and all fields included on the original submission, except for the \nfirmROEID participate in full duplicate checking. \n7. When full duplicates are identified, one event will be kept and all other events which fully \nduplicate the record will be rejected when submitted within the Processing Window. Full \nduplicates submitted outside the Processing Window will be marked late. \n8. When Event Key duplicates are identified, all events having the duplicated key will result in \nrejections for all records with the same key. \n9. Events that passed Event Key duplicate validations participate in the process which generates \nlinkages.  \n10. When Linkage Key duplicates are identified, all events having the duplicated Linkage Key will \nresult in in unlinked errors for all records with the same key. \n11. When linkages are expected but do not occur, a linkage error will be generated reflecting an \nunlinked event.  \n12. In cases when linkage did not occur between venues, unlinked feedback will be generated for the \nCAT Reporter whose record did not link and the CAT Reporter that was named. Separate error \ncodes will be assigned.  \n13. One or more linkage errors may be found within a record.  \n14. Named errors are considered repaired when the unlinked event is repaired. \n15. Linkage feedback for unlinked errors will be provided in the submission format of the unlinked \nevent, including named unlinked errors. \n16. Linkage feedback for named unlinked errors will be provided in the format of the original \nsubmission unless the CAT Reporter specifies a preference for named unlinked errors that is \ndifferent than the unlinked errors on the CAT Reporter Portal. \n17. Linkage Discovery Error Data Feedback Files will be limited to an uncompressed file size of 1GB.  \n18. Multiple Unlinked Error Data Feedback Files will be provided to ensure the file size maximum is \nnot exceeded. The File Feedback number will be incremented to ensure the feedback file name is \nnot duplicated. \n19. When there are no Linkage Discovery Errors, an empty file will be returned with a .success \nextension. \n20. Linkage Feedback Files are named by CAT. These feedback files represent Linkage Feedback \nacross all submissions for the CATReporterIMID/Submitter combination. The Feedback is not \nassociated with specific submission file(s). The file name includes the Processing Date for which \nthe Unlinked Feedback represents.     \nVersion 4.1.0 r4  344 \n21. Linkage Feedback Files present linkage fields as they were ingested, not as they were processed \nfor linkage. For example, leading and trailing zeros on a routedOrderID or session will be \nreflected in Linkage Feedback Files as they were ingested although they are removed for linkage \nprocessing. \n7.5.1. Linkage Discovery Feedback Definitions \nLinkage Discovery Errors include unlinked events reported by the CAT Reporter, and unlinked events on \nwhich the CAT Reporter was named. For named linkage errors, a subset of fields will be provided.  Refer \nto CAT Alert 2019-04 for additional information on named linkage errors.   \nThere are six types of Unlinked Data errors including: \nUnlinked Type Feedback Definition \n\u2022 Unlinked error reported by the CAT Reporter for all \nevent types \nTable 159: Linkage Error \u2013 Event Reported by CAT Reporter \n\u2022 Named on an Unlinked Industry Member Order \nEvent  \nTable 160: Linkage Errors \u2013 Named on Unlinked Industry \nMember Order Event \n\u2022 Named on an Unlinked Industry Member Quote \nEvent  \nTable 161: Linkage Errors \u2013 Named on Unlinked Industry \nMember Quote Event \n\u2022 Named on an Unlinked Exchange Event/Display-\nOnly Facility Equity BBO Event \nTable 162: Linkage Errors \u2013 Named on Unlinked Exchange \nEvent/Display-Only Facility Equity BBO Event \n\u2022 Named on an Unlinked Trade Report Table 163: Linkage Errors \u2013 Named on Unlinked Trade Report \n\u2022 Linkage Error Summary Table 164: Linkage Error Summary File \n \n7.5.1.1.
