      - Are allocations to a registered investment advisor (RIA)/money manager’s average price account required to be reported even if the shares are only held there temporarily before being allocated to individual customer accounts?

The shares are booked to an average price account designated for the RIA at the self-clearing firm until the RIA provides subaccount allocation instructions and the allocations are made to the individual customer accounts.
