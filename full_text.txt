1.  Introduction 
1.1. CAT Overview 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Rule 613 under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, which requires national securities exchanges and national securities associations (collectively, 
the Participants) to submit a national market system plan to create, implement, and maintain a 
consolidated audit trail (CAT NMS Plan) that would capture customer and order event information for 
orders in NMS Securities and OTC Equity Securities (Eligible Securities), across all markets, from the 
time of order inception through routing, cancellation, modification, execution, and allocation. The SEC 
approved the CAT NMS Plan on November 15, 2016. 
In accordance with SEC Rule 613, the CAT NMS Plan requires a Central Repository that will 
comprehensively track orders throughout their lifecycle and identify the Participants and Industry 
Members handling them, as well as the account holders and authorized traders for any account that 
originates an order (Customers3). Specific data elements will be submitted to the Central Repository by 
Participants, Industry Members, and CAT Reporting Agents. CAT Reporting Agents may be third- party 
firms reporting on behalf of other entities, or may be outside parties that are not required to submit data to 
the CAT, but from which the CAT may receive data per the CAT NMS Plan, such as the Securities 
Information Processors (SIPs). 
The CAT NMS Plan also requires the selection of an entity as the Plan Processor to be responsible for 
performing the processing functions required by Rule 613 and the Plan. The Operating Committee of 
Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC, a governing body composed of representatives of the Participants, 
oversees the operation of the CAT. The duties of the Operating Committee are further described in Article 
IV of the CAT NMS Plan. 
Refer to SEC Rule 613, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34- 67457.pdf for more details. 
Refer also to CAT NMS Plan, available at: https://www.catnmsplan.com/about-cat/cat-nms-plan.  
 
 
3 Customers are defined in SEC Rule 613(j)(3) as: (i) the account holder(s) of the account at a registered broker-dealer originating 
the order; and (ii) any person from whom the broker-dealer is authorized to accept trading instructions for such account, if 
different from the account holder(s).     
Version 4.1.0 r4  2 
1.2. Registration 
Industry Members are required to register for the CAT NMS System by June 27, 2019 regardless of what 
phase they begin reporting. Third Party Transmitters are also required to register for the CAT NMS 
System prior to submission.  
The Registration Form is available on the CAT Public Website, along with additional information on the 
registration process. Contact help@finracat.com for any questions regarding the registration process.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  3 
2. CAT Reporting Fundamentals 
2.1. Industry Member Perspective 
Industry Members must populate fields from their perspective. For example, for “ capacity”, the Industry 
Member must report based on the capacity in which the Industry Member acted. For New Order and 
Order Accepted events, reports must indicate the instructions as received. For an Order Route, the fields 
must include the instructions as sent to the destination. 
2.2. Key Data Elements 
The sections below describe the key data elements of CAT that may be used in CAT events.  
2.2.1. Firm Identifiers in File Submissions 
The CAT submissions process relies on certain firm identifiers to determine whose data is being reported, 
to determine and verify the authorization of the submitter of the data. 
CAT Reporter IMID 
The CAT Reporter IMID is the SRO-assigned identifier that an Industry Member uses to report to CAT. A 
CAT Reporter may use any SRO-assigned identifier that is valid on the CAT Trading Day for which CAT 
events are submitted. CAT will use reference data submitted by Participant Reporters each day to identify 
the Industry Member to which the specific identifier is assigned. Each SRO-assigned identifier is linked to 
the Industry Member's CRD number so that all reporting activity of a single Industry Member CAT reporter 
can be consolidated at the firm level in CAT. Refer to Section 2.4.1.1 for additional information on 
populating the CAT Reporter IMID. 
CAT Submitter ID 
The CAT Submitter ID is a CAT assigned identifier for a firm that submits data to CAT. The Submitter ID 
uniquely identifies the Submitter and is not the same identifier as the CAT Reporter IMID. CAT Reporters 
may submit data for themselves or may authorize a Reporting Agent to report on the CAT Reporter’s 
behalf.  
Authorization between CAT Reporters, Submitter and CAT Reporting Agents is granted through a 
reporting relationship that will be entered by the CAT Reporter using the CAT Reporter Portal. When a file 
is received, CAT will verify that the CAT Reporter has authorized the Submitter to submit on their behalf.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  4 
If the Submitter is an Industry Member, the CAT Submitter ID is the Submitter’s CRD number. If the 
Submitter is not an Industry Member and does not have a CRD number (i.e., Service Bureaus), the CAT 
Submitter ID is the Submitter’s Organization ID. Service bureaus may contact the FINRA CAT Helpdesk 
to obtain their Organization ID. 
2.3. Order ID 
The order ID used in CAT events represents the internal order ID assigned by the Industry Member. The 
order ID is used as a Linkage Key and must be unique when combined with the orderKeyDate, 
CATReporterIMID and symbol (or optionID). Other key linkage fields are fully described in Section 2.6.1. 
2.3.1. Timestamps 
Each Industry Member must record and report Industry Member Data captured in an electronic system to 
CAT with timestamps in milliseconds. CAT will accept granularity up to nanoseconds. To the extent that 
any Industry Member’s order handling or execution systems utilize timestamps in increments finer than 
milliseconds, the Industry Member must truncate its timestamps after the nanosecond level. Refer to CAT 
FAQs B2 and B8 for additional information. 
Each Industry Member may record and report Manual CAT events in increments up to and including one 
second, provided that each Industry Member records and reports the time when a Manual CAT Event has 
been captured electronically in an order handling and execution system of such Industry Member 
(“Electronic Capture Time”) in milliseconds. Allocation Reports must be reported in increments up to and 
including one second. 
Each CAT event contains both an eventTimestamp and electronicTimestamp. The eventTimestamp is the 
time of order handling or execution pursuant to Section 6.8 of the CAT NMS Plan (e.g. origination, 
receipt) depending on the respective order event. For manual order handling, eventTimestamp is the 
manual handling or execution time, which is required to be reported in increments of at least one second. 
When the manual order is later captured electronically, the systematized time must be captured in the 
electronicTimestamp field.  
2.3.2. Order Handling Instructions 
Special handling instructions are reported in the handlingInstructions field using a standardized list of 
handling instruction codes. Multiple handling instruction values can be used in combination to report 
special handling instructions. Refer to Appendix G: Data Dictionary 
     
Version 4.1.0 r4  5 
Industry Members are required to report handlingInstructions on Order Route events. In the event an 
Industry Member routes an order externally with exactly the same handling instructions received from the 
customer/client, they may use handlingInstructions value ‘RAR’ (Routed as Received) on the Order Route 
event rather than re-stating all handlingInstructions values from the New Order/Order Accepted event.  
In accordance with the November 2, 2023 SEC exemptive Relief Order (Release No. 34-98848), Industry 
Members are not required to report the following six special handling instructions when an Industry 
Member routes an order to at exchanges over an exchange port that is configured for one of the special 
handling instructions:4 
1. ATT Attributable. Order is routed to an exchange or ATS with instructions that the order is 
 attributable 
2. DNI Do Not Increase 
3. DNR Do Not Reduce 
4. DNRT Do Not Route 
5. RLO Retail Liquidity Order 
6. STP Self Trade Prevention 
This exception is exclusively with respect to Industry Member reporting obligations when routing orders 
over an exchange port that is configured for one of these special handling instructions. CAT,  LLC will 
submit an exemptive relief request to the SEC to include ‘AUC’ and ‘AOK’ in the list of Exempted Port-
Level Settings.

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 608(e) of Regulation NMS under the Exchange Act, from 
Certain Requirements of the National Market System Plan Governing the Consolidated Audit Trail” (November 2, 2023).

CAT-NMS-Plan.pdf.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  6 
2.3.3. Firm ROE ID 
The Firm ROE ID is the internal identifier assigned by the Industry Member to uniquely represent a record 
in CAT. The firmROEID is present on every CAT event and is used to support the corrections process.  
The firmROEID must be unique for the Event Date and CAT Reporter IMID and is required to be 
formatted as follows: <Event Date>_<firm ROE Identifier>. This requirement applies to CAT Reporters 
that use multiple Submitters. An example of a firmROEID is: 20190429_323134567. 
Event Date must represent the date portion of the eventTimestamp reported in the record. The inclusion 
of the event date provides processing efficiency for the corrections process by allowing the CAT 
Processor an efficient mechanism to locate the record being corrected. 
Refer to Section 7.6 for more information on the corrections process. 
2.3.4. Error ROE ID 
The Error ROE ID is the identifier assigned by CAT to uniquely identify an error record.  The errorROEID 
is returned with error feedback to provide a mechanism for firms to repair errors generated during 
processing. When firms are submitting corrections to CAT that represent a repair of an error, the 
errorROEID provides an efficient mechanism to locate the error record being repaired.  
Refer to Section 7.6 for more information on the corrections process. 
2.4. Reference Data 
2.4.1. Industry Member Identifiers  
An Industry Member Identifier is any identifier assigned by an SRO to one of its members. Examples of 
SRO-assigned identifiers include FINRA MPIDs, Nasdaq MPIDs, NYSE Mnemonics, Cboe EFIDs , and 
CHX Acronyms. Most Industry Members have multiple IMIDs. The following sections will provide 
guidance on which IMID to use for various fields and reporting circumstances.  
2.4.1.1. IMID in the CATReporterIMID field 
Populated in file names and optionally on CAT Events, the CATReporterIMID identifies the Industry 
Member whose data is represented in the CAT Event. The CATReporterIMID is populated with the SRO-
assigned identifier used to report to CAT. The CATReporterIMID is used to consolidate activity occurring 
both within the CATReporterIMID and at the firm (CRD) level. It also participates in the Linkage Keys 
used for Intrafirm Linkage and TRF Linkage. The CATReporterIMID does not participate in the Linkage 
Keys for Interfirm Linkage.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  7 
The CATReporterIMID is populated with the SRO-assigned identifier used to report to CAT according to 
the following requirements: 
1. FINRA members must populate the CAT Reporter IMID with the same MPID that it uses for related 
trade reporting facility (TRF) trade reporting, or, for quoting on an interdealer quotation system.  
2. FINRA members that operate an alternative trading system (ATS) must use their FINRA ATS MPID.  
3. If there is no ATS, TRF or quoting MPID requirement, any valid FINRA MPID may be populated.  
4. Non-FINRA members may use any effective identifier of the firm as included in the Daily published 
Member Dictionary, as described in the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for Plan Participants .  
5. When a CAT Reporter routes between different IMIDs of the same firm (same CRD), the CAT 
Reporter IMID may not be populated with the same value on the Order Route and Order Accepted 
events.  
6. The CATReporterIMID populated in the Data File name and in the CAT event (if populated) must be 
equal, otherwise the record will be rejected.  
2.4.1.2. IMID on Routing Events in the senderIMID, receiverIMID and destination Fields 
IMIDs are populated in Order Accepted, Order Route, New Quote and Quote Received events with the 
Industry Member identifier used when routing between venues. This identifier is known to both parties 
and is required to be populated in the senderIMID, receiverIMID and destination fields where applicable.  
The IMID participates in the Linkage Keys used for Interfirm Linkage and Exchange Linkage. When the 
same Industry Member Identifier (IMID) is assigned by different SROs to represent different Industry 
Members, an IMID conflict is created. To avoid conflicts, to simplify the population of the Industry Member 
Identifiers, and to streamline linkage processing, CAT reporters must populate the senderIMID, 
receiverIMID and destination (when routing to an IM) fields with both the CRD and IMID, formatted as 
<CRD of the CAT Reporter>:<IMID of the Industry Member performing the action in the CAT event>. The 
Industry Member ID must include the identifier that is known by the routing firm and destination venue. 
For example: CRD 123, IMID ABC is formatted as 123:ABC. 
The IMID provided in the senderIMID, receiverIMID and destination fields can be different than the CAT 
Reporter IMID. For example, CAT Reporter ABCD (CRD 123) may use FRMA as its CAT Reporter IMID, 
but when routing to Exchange A, it uses the exchange assigned identifier ABC. In this scenario, on its 
Order Route event, Firm A would populate its identifier in the CAT Reporter IMID field as FRMA and its 
identifier in the senderIMID field as 123:ABC.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  8 
For orders received from or routed to an alternative trading system (ATS), the FINRA ATS MPID must be 
used. FINRA members must use the same MPID for CAT reporting that it uses for related trade reporting 
facility (TRF) trade reporting, or, for quoting on an interdealer quotation system. If there is no ATS, TRF or 
quoting MPID requirement, firms may agree to use any valid FINRA MPID when routing to or receiving 
from another FINRA member, as long as both CAT Reporters use the same MPID as the IMID. Routing 
identifiers representing FINRA members are populated as: <FINRA Member CRD>:<FINRA Member 
MPID>. 
For orders received from or routed to a non-FINRA member firm, firms must agree to use the same IMID 
when reporting events to CAT. Non-FINRA members may use any effective identifier of the firm. Routing 
identifiers representing non-FINRA members are populated as: <non-FINRA Member CRD>:<non-FINRA 
Member MPID>. 
For orders routed to or received from an exchange, CAT reporters must populate the IMID with both the 
CRD and exchange assigned identifier used in the order route message to the exchange, formatted as 
<CRD>:<exchange assigned identifier>. 
Refer to Section 2.6.3.1 for additional information on how IMIDs participate in linkage. 
2.4.1.3. Default IMIDs 
The Plan Processor will publish each day a list of all SRO-assigned identifiers that includes a designated 
default IMID. The default IMID is selected by each CAT Reporter when they register as a CAT Reporter. 
The published default IMID must only be used if two parties do not have a pre-determined agreement as 
to which IMID to use when routing between each other. However, the default IMID is not intended to 
replace communication between the sender and receiver.  
Routing identifiers populated using a default IMID are populated as: <default IMID CRD>:<default IMID>.  
Example: A non-FINRA member firm (CRD 999) has a Cboe-assigned option identifier and a NYSE-
assigned equity identifier, as follows:  
• Cboe-assigned options ID - BDAO  
• NYSE-assigned equity ID – BDA (default IMID)  
 
In this example, when a second firm receives an order from the above firm, and the second firm does not 
have an agreement with the above firm as to which IMID to use, IMID BDA should be used to avoid a 
linkage error. The routing identifier is populated as 999:BDA.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  9 
2.4.2. Firm Designated ID (FDID) 
Section 6.4 of the CAT NMS Plan requires that for the original receipt or origination of an order, Industry 
Members must report the Firm Designated ID (FDID). FDID is defined in Section 1.1 of the CAT NMS 
Plan as: 
“…(1) a unique and persistent identifier for each trading account designated by Industry Members 
for purposes of providing data to the Central Repository provided, however, such identifier may 
not be the account number for such trading account if the trading account is not a proprietary 
account; (2) a unique and persistent relationship identifier when an Industry Member does not 
have an account number available to its order handling and/or execution system at the time of 
order receipt, provided, however, such identifier must be masked; or (3) a unique and persistent 
entity identifier when an employee of an Industry Member is exercising discretion over multiple 
client accounts and creates an aggregated order for which a trading account number of the 
Industry Member is not available at the time of order origination, where each such identifier is 
unique among all identifiers from any given Industry Member.” 
Before the reporting of Full Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying Information begins, 
regulatory users of the CAT will use FDIDs to identify whether the same account is trading within a single 
broker-dealer. After the reporting of Full Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying 
Information begins, FDIDs will be used to link accounts to specific customers, including mapping 
accounts with common ownership (for instance, where a customer is associated with more than one 
FDID). Therefore, FDID is required to be populated on all Transaction Order events requiring FDID for 
both equities and options. 
Industry Members must assign a single FDID to each trading account that is unique, persistent and 
consistent within the firm and across all vendors and systems the Industry Member may use to report 
Transaction Order events requiring an FDID to CAT and associated Customer and Account information 
for the FDID to CAT CAIS, and unique across time. For example, if an Industry Member uses multiple 
vendors for reporting Transaction data to CAT, the Industry Member must ensure that all vendors use the 
same FDID for a particular trading account in all CAT Transaction Order events requiring an FDID, and 
that the same FDID associated with the trading account is submitted to the Customer and Account 
Information System. 
Examples of what an FDID would represent include: 
• Individual Customer Account Number  
• Institutional Customer Account Number      
Version 4.1.0 r4  10 
• Account Number of Average Price Account Designated for a Specific Customer (e.g., Master 
Account or agency Representative Order scenarios)  
• Account Number of Firm Average Price Account Shared Across Customers (e.g., Master Account, 
Account Used for Agency Representative Order Flows)  
• Proprietary Trading Account Number  
• Firm assigned identifier representing a trading relationship (Relationship ID) can be used when 
the trading account structure is unavailable at the time the order was placed  
• Industry Member assigned identifier (Entity ID) representing the Industry Member’s discretionary 
relationship with the client when an employee of the Industry Member is exercising discretion 
over multiple client accounts and creates an aggregated order for which a trading account 
number of the Industry Member is unavailable at the time of order origination  
An actual customer account number must not be used as the FDID for a customer account for CAT 
reporting and the same guidance would apply to an FDID representing a Relationship ID . See CAT FAQ 
M2 for more information on the prohibition on use of actual account numbers, and CAT FAQs M10 and 
M14 for more information on masking. Also, refer to the CAT Industry Presentation on FDID for additional 
information.  
A change/replacement in the FDID value associated with a particular trading account, Relationship ID and 
Entity ID would be an isolated event that is only permissible in certain limited circumstances, such as 
system migration, change of vendors, change in Clearing Firm and change in masking methodology used 
for FDID values. See CAT FAQ M16 for more information on replacing/changing an FDID. 
Refer to Section 4.2 and Section 5.1.2 for details on reporting an FDID when an order is received for a 
new account and the new account number, on which the FDID is based, is not yet available.  
Refer to the CAT Reporting Customer and Account Technical Specifications for Industry Members and 
the CAT CAIS Industry Member Reporting Scenarios for information on reporting FDIDs to the CAT 
Customer & Account Information System (“CAIS”).     
Version 4.1.0 r4  11 
2.4.2.1. FDID Validation 
CAT will validate that the value reported in the firmDesignatedID and newOrderFDID fields on applicable 
order and allocation events are present in Customer and Account Information System (CAIS) data. 5 
CAT also validates that the firmDesignatedID field in order and allocation events contain values that are 
valid on the specified Event Date.6 Specifically, that the associated CAIS data has at least one Customer 
associated with the firmDesignatedID on or before the Event Date, and that the firmDesignatedID has no 
set fdidEndDate, or has an fdidEndDate set on or after the Event Date.  CAT will consider both the 
tradeDate and the Event Date when validating the value provided in the firmDesignatedID  field on 
allocation events with associated CAIS data, but only consider the tradeDate field when validating the 
value provided in the newOrderFDID field. 
FDID validation errors caused by missing or incorrect CAIS data must be resolved by the submission of 
corrected data to CAIS. Corrections to CAIS are due by T+3 @ 5:00 PM ET, as outlined in the CAT 
Reporting Customer and Account Information Technical Specifications for Industry Members -Full CAIS. 
The related transaction errors will be reconciled by CAT. 
FDID validation errors caused by incorrect transaction data must be resolved by the submission of 
corrected data to CAT. Corrections to CAT are due by T+3 @ 8:00 AM ET. See Table 148: Reporting 
Deadline Examples for more information. 
2.4.3. Equity Symbols 
Industry Members must report CAT Events related to listed equity Eligible Securities to CAT using the 
symbology of the primary listing exchange and must report CAT Events related to OTC Equity Securities 
using FINRA OTC symbology.  
 
 
5 This is based on data available in the CAIS Production Environment. See Error Codes 3709 and 3710 for additional details on 
newOrderFDID validation. 
6 For Error Codes and validations, Event Date is the date portion of the eventTimestamp.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  12 
2.4.3.1. CAT Symbol Master 
CAT will provide a start-of-day equity symbol master list, an intraday equity symbol master list, and an 
end-of-day equity symbol master list each day on the CAT Public Website.  
The symbol master file for Industry Members contains the following information:  
• Listing exchange for listed securities with the symbol in the symbology of the listing exchange  
• FINRA symbology for OTC Equity Securities 
• Flag indicating whether the symbol is a test symbol. 
Guidance for reporting order events occurring prior to an IPO symbol’s inclusion on the CAT Reportable 
Securities List in Phase 2d is still under consideration7. Refer to CAT FAQ A33 for additional information. 
2.4.4. Option Symbols 
As stated above, the CAT NMS Plan requires symbols to be reported to CAT in the symbology of the 
listing exchange. Standard option symbols established across exchanges as the result of the Option 
Symbology Initiative (OSI) must be used for any single-leg listed options.  
2.4.4.1. Flex Percent Option Symbols 
FLEX Percent (FLEXPCT) options are a specific type of FLEX option where the strike price of the FLEX 
option is initially specified as a percentage of the closing price of the underlying instrument (equity or 
index) on that day. The order is entered and traded prior to the determination of the final strike price. At 
the time the order is accepted by the exchange, the symbol of the option is specified as a modified 
version of an OSI code as described below. 
Example: %4SPXW 230818P00097000

This is an interim symbol that is used during the trading day within the exchange trading system. This 
interim symbol is only valid for a single trading day on which it was created (but the same symbol may be 
reused on a subsequent date to represent a new FLEXPCT option). The FLEXPCT symbol is 22 
characters including a prefix of “%” to clearly indicate that it is a FLEXPCT option. Because FLEXPCT 
options are created during the trading day, the symbols are submitted to CAT by the exchange in intraday 
option dictionary files and are only ever present on the CAT Reportable Options Securities Symbol 
Master EOD. 
After the market closes, the exchange determines that actual strike price in dollars, and issues a 
permanent OSI symbol which is sent to the OCC for listing and publication. Only this permanent symbol 
can be used for allocation and clearing. 
In the hypothetical example of %4SPXW 230818P00097000, let’s say the closing price of the SPX index 
is 4,555. Calculating 97% of 4,555 = 4418.35 which becomes the dollar strike price of the new FLEX 
Option. The final OSI code is issued 4SPXW 230818P04418350. This is a standard 21-character OSI 
code, which will be used for clearing and settlement, and all future trading of this option series.

2.4.5. Underlying Instrument for Multi-leg Orders  
For multi-leg orders containing an equity option leg, populate the stock symbol in the symbology of the 
primary listing exchange. The value can be found in the symbol field of the CAT Reportable Equities 
Securities Symbol Master. This is the same symbology required for equity order events.  
For multi-leg orders containing index option legs, populate the OCC underlying symbol, which can be 
found in the primaryDeliverable field of the CAT Reportable Options Securities Symbol Master. Please 
note that the underlying symbol is not always reflective of the first 6 characters of the OSI symbol.  
Refer to the following examples which demonstrate cases when the underlying is the same and when the 
underlying is different from the first 6 characters of the OSI symbol, such as FLEX options and options 
that have undergone a corporate action.

STAN|SPXW  221230C04475000|SPX|E|PM|N 
In the uncommon case where a multi-leg order contains option legs that do not all share the same 
underlying instrument, the Industry Member must provide a valid symbol for any of the legs.  
Beginning on December 5, 2022, an error will be generated when a value is provided in the underlying 
field of a multi-leg event, but that value is not a valid symbol or option id for the event date.  
2.4.6. Corporate Actions  
The CAT System will maintain historical symbology in the Central Repository that includes corporate 
actions.  
CAT will receive daily corporate action files and symbol updates from the various data sources (including 
equity and options listing exchanges, FINRA OTC Equity Symbols, Data Distribution Services from 
Options Clearing Corporation, etc.) and publish daily symbol master files to the Industry Members. The 
symbol changes impacted by corporate actions will be reflected in the daily symbol master files. Industry     
Version 4.1.0 r4  15 
Members must use the updated symbol in Reportable Events from the effective date of the symbol 
change. Failure to report in the updated symbol would result in rejects of the record(s).  
Industry Members are not required to report order adjustments due to corporate actions, e.g., price or 
size changes. However, if an Industry Member chooses to report an adjustment resulting from a 
corporate action, the adjustment must be reported using the Order Modified event (or Order Adjusted 
event).  
2.4.6.1. Options Intraday Listing or Delisting 
CAT accommodates intraday listing of options by exchanges. Industry Members must report the OSI 
symbol as the optionID, just like for previously listed options.  
CAT will maintain a historical record of option symbols, including symbols that have been delisted. 
Exchanges and the OCC will provide reference data to CAT for option symbols that are listed or delisted 
intraday. 
2.5. Data Types 
CAT will accept two kinds of text-based files: JSON and CSV. Data types used throughout this document 
are described below.  
To support JSON and CSV submissions, the Industry Member Schema (JSON) file is available on the 
CAT public website that describes each data type with required representation formats and a mapping 
that defines the position in a CSV representation.  
2.5.1. Data Validation Based on Data Types 
All data submitted to CAT will be validated based on the defined data type of each item, including proper 
formatting and range checking. All File Names, Field Names and Field Values are case sensitive in CAT 
with the exception of Data Type BOOLEAN. During validations, if the case does not match, an error will 
occur. Examples of accepted values are detailed in the table below. Valid values for Choice fields are 
defined in Appendix G: Data Dictionary for each data element. Valid data values, ranges, and formats will 
be specified in the record schema files, which will be used to validate submitted data element values. 
Records and values that fail validation will be rejected and will be reported as feedback to the Reporter 
and Data Submitter as detailed in Section 7. 
Table 3: Data Types 
Data Type JSON Type Description     
Version 4.1.0 r4  16 
Data Type JSON Type Description 
Numeric NUMBER Composed of digits with an optional decimal point. Values must represent 
the exact value as per the examples:  
1235 
-1235 
1235.67 
-1235.67 
 
Numeric data types described in this document will include two numbers, 
the first is the maximum number of digits before the decimal point, and the 
second is the maximum number of digits after the decimal point. For 
example, Numeric (6,4) indicates that the number can have a maximum of 6 
digits before the decimal point and a maximum of 4 digits after the decimal 
point. 
 
Examples which comply with Numeric (6,4) include:  
-999999.9999 
-0.1 
0 
0.0001 
100 
100.100 
999999.99 
0.25 
099999.9990 
0999999.99990 
Numeric values must always include a digit in the portion before the 
decimal. The fractional portion is optional. (for example, 0.25 cannot be 
represented as .25).  
 
Examples which do not comply with Numeric (6,4) include: 
1234567.0 
.123 
1.12345 
10. 
40a 
 
Numeric data types that require 0 digits after the decimal place should not  
include a decimal. The following example does not comply with Numeric 
(6,0): 
1234.5 
1234.0 
Price NUMBER Numeric (10,8), which supports prices in the inclusive range from  
-9999999999.99999999 to 9999999999.99999999. See FAQ I9 for details 
on reporting prices to CAT that are in non-U.S. dollar currency. 
Real Quantity  NUMBER Numeric (12,6) with up to 12 digits before the decimal point and up to 6 
digits after the decimal point. The type Real Quantity should not have 
trailing zeros in the decimal quantities.  
For example, 100 would be accepted. Real Quantity must not be a negative 
value.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  17 
Data Type JSON Type Description 
Whole Quantity  NUMBER Numeric (12,0). An integer value with no decimal fraction component. Whole 
Quantity must not be a negative value. 
Integer NUMBER An integer value (positive, negative, or zero), with no decimal fraction 
component, in the inclusive range from −9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 
9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (the same range as a 64-bit signed integer). 
Unsigned NUMBER An unsigned value, greater than or equal to zero, with no decimal fraction 
component, in the inclusive range from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 
(the same range as a 64-bit unsigned integer). 
Boolean BOOLEAN A value with two choices: true or false. Boolean values are NOT case 
sensitive. 
In CSV representation, when required field, the value must equal true or 
false (no quotation marks). If the field is optional or conditional and no 
value is reported, then the value is considered false in CSV representation. 
In JSON representation, if the field is not present, the value is considered 
false for required, conditional and optional fields.  
 
Alphanumeric STRING A string, composed only of letters and digits [a-zA-Z0-9]. When an 
Alphanumeric type is described, it will include a number, indicating the 
maximum length of the field. For example, Alphanumeric (7) means that the 
field can contain up to 7 characters. Alphanumeric values are case 
sensitive. 
Text STRING A string, composed of any printable ASCII character from 32 to 126. The 
string may not include the following characters which serve as delimiters:  
comma (ASCII decimal 44, hex 2C),  
pipe (ASCII decimal 124, hex 7C),  
double quote (ASCII decimal 34, hex 22), and  
@ (ASCII decimal 64, hex 40). 
 
When a Text data type is described, it will include a number, indicating the 
maximum length of the field. For example, Text (7) means that the field can 
contain up to 7 characters. Text values are case sensitive. 
 
When represented in JSON, the following rule applies: 
Backslash ‘\’ is a reserved printable character in JSON and must be 
escaped in order to be used in strings by inserting a backslash prior to it 
within the string. For example: routedOrderID = 1234\ABCD must be 
reported to CAT as “routedOrderID”:”1234\\ABCD”.  
If the backslash is not escaped, it will be omitted from the string. For 
example, if the following is reported to CAT, “routedOrderID”:”1234\ABCD”, 
it will be stored as routedOrderID = 1234ABCD. 
Escape characters do not participate in the field value length. 
Date NUMBER An 8-digit integer representing the date in YYYYMMDD. 
Timestamp STRING or 
Unsigned 
NUMBER 
A timestamp represents a moment in time. Two timestamp formats are 
supported including STRING and NUMBER. 
 
Timestamps formatted as a STRING have a maximum length of 25 and are 
formatted as ‘YYYYMMDD HHMMSS.CCCNNNNNN’ with the Date and 
Time portions, separated by a space (ASCII decimal 32, hex 20) or the letter 
T (ASCII decimal 84, hex 54). All timestamps submitted in STRING format 
must be in Eastern Time (ET).     
Version 4.1.0 r4  18 
Data Type JSON Type Description 
• The Date portion must include four digit year, two digit month, and two 
digit day. Valid values: YYYY = 0000 - 9999, MM = 00 - 12, DD = 00 – 
31.  
• The Time portion must include a two digit hour, two digit minute, two 
digit seconds. Valid values: HH = 00 - 23, MM = 01 - 59, SS = 01 - 59, 
CCC = 000 – 999, NNNNNN = 000000 - 999999. 
 
Examples which comply with Timestamp in STRING format:  
• 20190617T000120.000000000 
• 20190617T000120 
• 20190617T000120.000 
• 20170107T213000.123456789 
• 20170107 213000.123456789 
• 20190617 000120.123000000 
 
Examples which do not comply with Timestamp in STRING format: 
• 20190617T0120 
• 20190617T000120. 
 
As an alternative format, timestamp can be submitted as a value of type 
Unsigned, representing the number of nanoseconds that have elapsed 
since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 
1970, not counting leap seconds. This is also commonly known as POSIX 
time or UNIX time. The same point in time from the above example would 
be represented as the number 1483842600123456789. Timestamps 
submitted in UTC must not be adjusted for Eastern Time. 
 
Note that the data type is different between the two formats. In JSON, the 
first representation requires it to be surrounded by double quotes, while the 
second does not. 
 
Examples which comply with Timestamp in NUMBER format:  
• 1483842600123456789 
 
Examples which do not comply with Timestamp in NUMBER format:  
• 20190617T000120 
• 20190617 000120 
Name/Value 
Pairs 
OBJECT An object composed of a list of zero or more attributes, where each attribute 
is either Boolean or Non-Boolean. A Boolean attribute is a Name and a 
Non-Boolean attribute is a Name with an accompanying paired Value. 
Multiple attributes are separated by a delimiter. Both Boolean and Non-
Boolean attributes are case sensitive. Refer to Appendix G: Data Dictionary 
 for a list of acceptable Boolean and non-Boolean attributes for the 
handlingInstructions and timeInForce Name/Value fields. 
 
When represented in JSON, the following rules apply: 
• The OBJECT is contained within curly brackets { }. 
• Name/Value Pairs are comma separated. 
• A Value accompanied by a Name must be formatted as per the data 
type syntax required in JSON.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  19 
Data Type JSON Type Description 
• A Boolean attribute should only include the Name. For example, if a 
handlingInstructions value of AOK (Auction or Kill) applies to an event, 
then it should be reported as "AOK": true. If AOK is not applicable to an 
event, then it should not be reported as "AOK": false; rather, it should 
not be reported at all.   
• A Name that can contain a list of Values must be formatted as per the 
data type syntax required in JSON, even when only one value is 
present in the list.   
 
For example, handlingInstructions are represented as follows in JSON:  
"handlingInstructions":{ 
"AOK": true, 
"DISP": 10.00, 
"TMO":"20190419T092316.123456789", 
"AucResp":"AuctionID456" 
“DLVT”:[“MM1”,”MM2”,”MM3”] 
} 
 
When represented in CSV, the following rules apply: 
• The OBJECT is represented in a single position delimited by comma. 
• Name/Value Pairs are pipe delimited. 
• A Boolean attribute should only include the Name. For example, if a 
handlingInstructions value of AOK (Auction or Kill) applies to an event, 
then it should be reported as AOK and it should NOT be reported as 
AOK=true. Similarly, if AOK is not applicable to an event, then it should 
not be reported as AOK=false; rather, it should not be reported at all. 
• A Name with multiple values must include an ‘@’ delimiter separating 
each Value. 
• Non-Boolean attributes which require a paired Value will include that 
value immediately after the Name and a single equal sign (ASCII 
decimal 61, hex 3D). 
 
In CSV, handlingInstructions is represented as:  
AOK|DISP=10.00|TMO=20190419T092316.123456789|AucResp= 
AuctionID456|DLVT=MM1@MM2@MM3 
 
timeInForce is also defined as a Name/Value Pair, however only one 
attribute is applicable. The following examples demonstrate how to 
represent in JSON and CSV: 
 
Ex JSON CSV 
1 "timeInForce":{"DAY": 
20190528} 
DAY=20190528 
2 "timeInForce":{"GTT": 
“20190528T160000.000000”} 
GTT=20190528T160000.000000 
3 “timeInForce”:{“IOC”: true} IOC 
Array ARRAY A list of 0, 1 or more values of the same data type. 
When represented in JSON, the following rules apply: 
• ARRAY is within a set of brackets [ ]     
Version 4.1.0 r4  20 
Data Type JSON Type Description 
• Elements within the array are comma separated.  
For example, atsOrderType is represented as the following in JSON: 
"atsOrderType":["PEG","midPEG"] 
 
When represented in CSV, the following rules apply: 
• ARRAY is represented in a single position delimited by comma 
• Elements in the array are pipe delimited 
 
When represented in CSV, it is: 
,,,PEG|midPEG,,, 
Choice STRING A Text field with an explicit list of acceptable values. Appendix G: Data 
Dictionary lists the acceptable values for each Choice field. 
Symbol STRING Text (22). Refer to Section 2.4.3 and Section 2.4.4 for more details on 
Equity and Options symbols. The string is case sensitive.  
Message Type STRING Alphanumeric (5) indicating the type of message being reported. 
CAT Reporter 
IMID 
STRING Alphanumeric (7) - a CAT Reporter IMID. 
Exchange ID STRING Alphanumeric (7) – identifier that applies to exchanges. 
CAT Submitter 
ID 
Unsigned 
NUMBER 
A unique ID assigned by CAT to the CAT Reporting Agent. 
Industry 
Member ID 
(IMID) 
STRING Text (16) – CRD and SRO-assigned Market Participant Identifier assigned 
by an SRO to one of its members.  
Formatted as <CRD of the Market Participant>:<SRO-assigned Market 
Participant Identifier>.  
Example: CRD 123, IMID ABCD is populated as 123:ABCD  
Multi-
Dimensional 
Array 
Multi-
Dimensional 
ARRAY 
A compound object that consists of an array of objects. The JSON and CSV 
syntax for this data type is consistent with other Multi-Dimensional Array 
JSON Types.  
 
When represented in JSON, the following rules apply: 
• ARRAY is within a set of brackets [ ]  
• Each OBJECT contained in the ARRAY is within curly brackets { } 
• Elements within each object are comma separated 
• Conditional elements that do not have a value are not required to be 
included. 
 
When represented in CSV, the following rules apply: 
• ARRAY is represented in a single position delimited by comma 
• Each object contained in the ARRAY is pipe delimited 
• Elements within each object are delimited by @ 
• All elements defined for the Object must be represented in their 
specified position, even when there is not applicable value. 
Trade Side 
Details 
Multi-
Dimensional 
ARRAY 
A compound object that consists of a list of data elements which supports 
the reporting of buy side details and sell side details in a Trade Event. When 
Trade Side Details are reported, each side will represent one set of details. 
buyDetails and sellDetails are two different fields. Each field is defined to 
contain an ARRAY that is limited to one object.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  21 
Data Type JSON Type Description 
For example, Trade Side Details (buyDetails and sellDetails) are 
represented as follows in JSON: 
 
"buyDetails" : [  
{"orderID" : "OrderABC",  
 "orderKeyDate": "20190419T000000", 
 "side" : "B"} 
], 
"sellDetails" : [ 
{"side" : "SL", 
 "firmDesignatedID" : "Prop123",  
 "accountHolderType" : "P"} 
] 
 
When represented in CSV, refer to the following example:

ARRAY 
A compound object that consists of a list of data elements that represents 
one or more orders being aggregated. The aggregatedOrders field may 
include 0, 1, or more orders, with each order having a set of required data 
elements. 
For example, an aggregatedOrders will be presented as following in JSON: 
"aggregatedOrders":[  
{"orderID" : "O1234",  
 "orderKeyDate": "20190419T000000"}, 
{"orderID" : "O1235",

O1236@1483842600123450000@800@,,, 
 
If the multi-dimensional array is blank, CSV must only contain the first level 
delimiter, the comma. Only comma acts as the place holder, the lower level     
Version 4.1.0 r4  22 
Data Type JSON Type Description 
delimiter ‘@’ must not be added. 
 
2.5.2. Required, Conditional, and Optional Fields  
Throughout this document, event types and their fields will be defined. Each field will be notated with the 
abbreviation R, C, O or A to represent whether it is required, conditional, optional or applicable for ATSs 
only. This codification will appear in the last column of each table describing an event.  
Table 4: Include Key 
Value Abbreviation Description 
Required R Required for the given event. This field must always be included. 
Conditional C Conditionally required for the given event, depending upon other values 
submitted in the Reportable Event message.  
Optional O Optional for the given event. May be included at the discretion of the 
reporter/submitter.  
ATS A Applicable for ATSs only. Required when the CAT Reporter IMID is an ATS. 
 
2.6. Linkage Overview 
This section describes the Linkage Keys that are used to create lifecycles in CAT and explains how the 
Linkage Keys are constructed via different data elements in respective Reportable Events. When 
combined, these data elements must create a Linkage Key that is unique. All Reportable Events will be 
linked in CAT via the daisy chain approach and do not rely on timestamps or sequence in order to link 
events within a lifecycle. 
2.6.1. CAT Linkage Keys 
Below is the list of Linkage Keys that connect CAT events within an Industry Member and across Industry 
Members. In instances of a merger or acquisition, the originatingIMID will be used in place of the 
CATReporterIMID to support linkage.

2.6.2. Reporting Responsibilities of Sender/Receiver 
Industry Members are responsible for reporting routes, modifications, and cancellations  to CAT. When 
modifying or cancelling orders, Industry Members are required to report any request received denoting 
the time that the request was received. Industry Members are not required to report the modification or 
cancellation request to CAT if the order is terminal (e.g., it has already been fully executed or cancelled) 
in Phase 2d. However, this activity may be required in future phases of CAT. If a modification or 
cancellation request was received that was too late to modify/cancel, and the order was not terminal (e.g. , 
the order was “in-flight” and there was no confirmation time), the request must be reported as an Order 
Modification/Order Cancel Request event.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  25 
Industry Members are not required to report requests to modify or cancel an order that were sent to 
another Industry Member broker-dealer or exchange. Separately, Industry Members are required to report 
a modification or cancel once the cancellation or modification was confirmed. 
Below is a list of sample scenarios and the reporting responsibilities of the sender (Broker A) and the 
receiver (Broker B). The sequence or action description may vary based on the values used to populate 
the timestamp for each event in accordance with requirements outlined in Sections 4 and 5.  This 
guidance is also applicable to the sender (Broker A) when routing to an Exchange instead of another 
Industry Member Broker-Dealer. Refer to the CAT Industry Member Reporting Scenarios document for 
detailed examples.

2.6.3. Summary of Route and TRF Linkage Keys 
Table 7 below summarizes the required data elements to construct the Route Linkage Key, which is used  
for linking Route and Order Accepted events reported by different entities in CAT. The combination of the 
data elements that make up the Route Linkage Key must be unique for the sender and receiver. When 
the Route Linkage Key is not unique, unlinked errors will be returned for all records having the same 
Route Linkage Key.  
The routedOrderID field, which participates in the Route Linkage Key, is defined as a Text field and must  
not include the following characters which serve as delimiters: comma, pipe, double quote, and the @ 
symbol. When reporting to CAT in JSON, backslash is a reserved printable character and must be 
escaped in order to participate in the routedOrderID. If a backslash is used in the routedOrderID field and 
is not escaped when reporting in JSON, route linkage errors may occur. Refer to Section 6.1.2.2 for 
additional guidance.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  28 
Table 7 below also summarizes the required data elements to construct the TRF Linkage Key, which is 
used for linking Trade events to the related media tape report in the TRF/ADF/ORF. Non-media trade 
reports are not included in TRF linkage. The combination of the data elements that make up the TRF 
Linkage Key must be unique. When the TRF Linkage Key is not unique, all events with the same TRF 
Linkage Key will be rejected. 
Industry Members may link to either the Reporting Side or the Contra Side of the related Trade Report , 
but may not combine elements between the Reporting Side and the Contra side of the Trade Report. If 
the CATReporterIMID in the MEOT record matches to the Reporting Side, the tapeTradeID must also 
match the Reporting Side. If the CATReporterIMID in the MEOT record matches to the Contra Side, the 
tapeTradeID must also match the Contra Side.  
For Participant related event details, refer to the Plan Participant Technical Specifications.

2.6.3.1. Routing Between Industry Members 
The Route Linkage Key used to link events between Industry Members must be unique for the Event 
Date, senderIMID, destination/receiverIMID, symbol/optionID and routedOrderID. Session does not 
participate in the Route Linkage Key for routes between Industry Members when validating for 
uniqueness and when performing linkages. 8 These requirements apply to both the sending and receiving 
Industry Member. 
Order linkage between industry members requires that the Route Linkage Key is equal between the 
sender and receiver. The sending and receiving firms must mutually agree on the IMID to be used if they 
have multiple SRO-assigned IMIDs. If there is no predetermined agreement between the sender and the 
receiver, firms may reference the default IMID list as outlined in Section 2.4.1.3. However, the default 
IMID list is not intended to replace communication between the sender and receiver.   
Leading zeros will be removed from the routedOrderID field when constructing the Route Linkage Key. 
The routedOrderID field is not required for manual routes when the manualFlag is populated ‘true’. 
Example Route Linkage Key when routing between Industry Members: CAT Reporter ABCD (CRD 
123) routes an order to DEFG (CRD 456). CAT Reporter DEFG receives the order. In this example, CAT 
Reporter ABCD uses the SRO-assigned identifier of ABC when routing.

8 Industry Members commonly establish multiple connections or “sessions” between counterparties. If Industry Members have 
multiple points of connection or sessions established with counterparties, Industry Members should be aware that many common 
protocols (i.e., FIX), require unique order IDs on each order message per session. Industry Members should take proactive steps to 
ensure Route Linkage Key uniqueness when establishing additional trading sessions between counterparties.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  31 
 
2.6.3.2. Routing to Exchanges 
The Route Linkage Key used to link Routes to Exchanges must be unique for the Event Date, 
senderIMID/routingParty, destination/exchange, symbol/optionID, routedOrderID and session. The 
session participates in the Route Linkage Key for routes to an Exchange; it is used when validating for 
uniqueness and when performing linkages. The session represents the name of the connection used 
when routing an order to a national securities exchange. 
When routing to exchanges, the destination must be the Exchange ID to which the order is routed. The 
senderIMID must be populated with the prefix equal to the CRD of the routing firm, and the suffix equal to 
exchange assigned identifier that was used in the order route message to the exchange . The identifier 
populated in the suffix must equal the routingParty field value reported by the exchange on the Participant 
Order Accepted event. See the Plan Participant Technical Specifications for more details. 
The senderIMID in this scenario may be different from the CATReporterIMID. Refer to Section 2.4.1.1 for 
additional guidance on how to populate the CATReporterIMID and senderIMID.  
The routedOrderID is assigned to the order by the Industry Member when routing the order to the 
exchange. The routedOrderID field must be reported to CAT in the exact format as sent to the exchange. 
Firms should take note of each exchange’s interface specifications regarding special characters or 
spaces as some exchange transmission protocols may remove certain characters  or spaces. Leading 
zeros will be removed from the routedOrderID and session fields when constructing the Route Linkage 
Key. This field value must match the value for routedOrderID reported by the exchange in their Order 
Accepted event.  
Example Route Linkage Key when routing to an Exchange: CAT Reporter ABCD (CRD 123) routes 
an order to Exchange EXCH. ABCD’s SRO identifier at EXCH is ABC.

For additional information on the values to be provided based on the exchange the order is routed to and 
specific guidance related to each field required for Exchange Route Matching, refer to the Order Routing 
Field Mapping document published on the IM Technical Specifications page of the CAT Public Website.   
2.6.3.3. Routing from an Exchange to the Exchange’s Routing Broker  
The Route Linkage Key used to link events between a route from an Exchange to the Exchange’s 
Routing Broker must be unique for the Event Date, exchange/senderIMID, routingParty/receiverIMID, 
symbol/optionID and routedOrderID. The session does not participate in the Route Linkage Key for routes 
between an Exchange and the Exchange’s Routing Broker when validating for uniqueness and when 
performing linkages.  
When an Industry Member that is an exchange routing broker receives an order routed from the 
exchange, the senderIMID field must be the Exchange ID from which the order is received. Firms 
receiving an order from an exchange must populate the receiverIMID with the prefix equal to the CRD of 
the receiving firm, and the suffix equal to the identifier known by the exchange sending the order. The 
identifier populated in the suffix must equal the routingParty field value reported by the exchange on the 
Participant Order Route event. See the Plan Participant Technical Specifications for more details. 
The receiverIMID in this scenario may be different from the CAT Reporter IMID. Refer to Section 2.4.1.1 
for additional guidance on how to populate the CAT Reporter IMID. 
Example Route Linkage Key when receiving an order from an Exchange: Routing Broker ABCD 
(CRD 123) receives an order from Exchange EXCH. ABCD’s SRO identifier at EXCH is ABC.

Version 4.1.0 r4  33 
2.6.3.4. Routing to Foreign Destinations and U.S. non-CAT Reporting Entities 
When an order is routed to a foreign non-CAT-reporting entity, the destinationType must be marked as ‘N’ 
(Foreign). When routing to a foreign non-CAT-reporting entity, there is no requirement to report 
senderIMID, destination, or routedOrderID, but an Industry Member may choose to populate these fields.  
When destinationType is ‘N’, a CRD Prefix is not required to be populated in the destination field if it is 
optionally populated. 
If an Industry Member is unable to guarantee record level uniqueness of simultaneous routes to a foreign 
destination without populating the senderIMID, destination, or routedOrderID fields, then the Industry 
Member must populate any combination of these fields on its Order Route event that will guarantee 
record level uniqueness. 
The destinationType and senderType values of ‘O’ for order events are used to support linkage in 
scenarios where an order in an OTC equity symbol of a foreign security is routed between Industry 
Members, and the sender or receiver may not have had a CAT reporting obligation in accordance with 
Section I of the CAT FAQs. When destinationType or senderType ‘O’ for order events is populated, 
linkage will be attempted on the Order Route or Order Accepted/Order Modified event. After linkage is 
attempted, if no link is found, the firm will not receive an unlinked error. Refer to the CAT Industry Member 
Reporting Scenarios document for detailed examples of reporting destinationType and senderType ‘O’ to 
CAT. 
Refer to Section I of the CAT FAQs for additional information on routing orders to a foreign destination.  
For not immediately actionable electronic RFQ responses, the destinationType and senderType values of 
‘N’ or ‘S’ are used to suppress linkage errors in scenarios where an quote event is routed to, or received 
from, a foreign Non-CAT Reporting entity such as a Foreign broker-dealer and a U.S. non-CAT Reporting 
entity. The Industry Member will not receive an unlinked error. When destinationType is ‘N’ or ‘S’, a CRD 
Prefix is not required to be populated in the destination field if it is optionally populated. When senderType 
is ‘N’ or ‘S’, a CRD Prefix is not required to be populated in the senderIMID field if it is optionally 
populated. 
2.6.3.5. Routes Rejected by the Destination Venue 
Industry Members will be required to report an Order Route event with the routeRejectedFlag populated 
as ‘true’ if a sender receives notification from the destination venue that a route has been rejected by the 
recipient. If the sender has not received acknowledgment from the destination venue after a time period 
determined by the sender, and the sender “abandons” the route, the sender may mark the     
Version 4.1.0 r4  34 
routeRejectedFlag as ‘true’. Additionally, an Order Route Supplement event may be used to populate the 
routeRejectedFlag as ‘true’. 
While Industry Members are responsible for accurately reporting the routeRejectedFlag  to CAT, linkage 
will be attempted on all Order Route events that contain a routeRejectedFlag as ‘true’ in order to account 
for instances where there may be a miscommunication between venues as to whether or not an order 
was accepted or rejected. After linkage is attempted, if no link is found, the firm will not receive an 
unlinked error if the routeRejectedFlag is populated as ‘true’.  
2.6.3.6. Option Floor Trades 
The Exchange Trade Linkage Key is used to link a manual options floor trade to the related Order Trade 
event reported by the participant. The Exchange Trade Linkage Key for manual options floor trades must 
be unique for the Event Date, optionID, tapeTradeID, and marketCenterID. The side will be included in 
the linkage key in order to ensure linkage to the correct side of the exchange OT.  The marketCenterID 
must be the Exchange ID of the floor where the execution occurred. The tapeTradeID must be populated 
with a value determined and provided by the exchange. 
Example Exchange Trade Linkage Key: Floor Broker ABCD (CRD 123) is the buyer in an order 
manually executed on the floor of Exchange EXCH.

the CAT Public Website.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  35 
2.6.3.7. Equity Exchange Trade Linkage 
In limited circumstances, the Exchange Trade Linkage Key is used to link a Trade event reported by an 
Industry Member to a related Order Trade event reported by a participant, as opposed to a related TRF 
report submitted by the Industry Member. 
NYSE Floor Cross 
The Exchange Trade Linkage Key for manual NYSE floor trades where the manualFlag is populated as 
‘true’ must be unique for the Event Date, symbol, and tapeTradeID. The marketCenterID must reflect a 
value of ‘N’ (New York Stock Exchange). The tapeTradeID must be populated with a value determined 
and provided by the exchange. 
Example Exchange Trade Linkage Key: Floor Broker ABCD (CRD 123) is the buyer in an order 
manually executed on the NYSE floor.

3. Special Reporting Requirements 
3.1. Alternative Trading Systems (“ATS”) Reporting 
ATSs are required to submit additional information in applicable CAT events. ATS fields must be 
populated if the CATReporterIMID is an ATS. Any ATS fields, such as workingPrice, that are not 
applicable to the event must be populated by the ATS using a value of “0”. Industry Members that are not 
ATSs must leave these fields blank.  
3.1.1. National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) 
ATSs are required to report NBBO information.  
The NBBO must be reported to CAT from the perspective of the ATS. Specifically, the NBBO (or relevant 
reference price) reported must be the NBBO in effect at the time of the order event, and the timestamp of 
when the ATS captured the effective NBBO (or relevant reference price). In addition, the ATS must 
identify the market data feed (NBBO Source) it used to obtain the NBBO (or relevant reference price).  
If another reference price, such as the primary market’s BBO, is used by the ATS, then the applicable 
reference price must be reported instead of the NBBO. If there is no price, the ATS must populate the 
nbbPrice and nboPrice fields with a value of “0”.  
While the nbbQty and nboQty fields are optional for ATSs, if an ATS chooses not to populate a quantity in 
these fields, they must be populated with a value of “0”. 
FINRA Rule 6830(a)(1)(A)(xi)(c) requires ATSs using an alternative NBBO feed from what was reported 
on its ATS data submission to notify FINRA of the fact that an alternative source was used, identify the 
alternative source, and specify the date(s), time(s) and securities for which the alternative source was 
used. In order to comply with FINRA Rule 6830(a)(1)(A)(xi)(c) for the purpose of CAT reporting, Industry 
Members must submit an ATS NBBO Source Change Form via email to FINRA CAT. Instructions for 
submitting this form are posted to www.catnmsplan.com/forms. 
3.1.2. ATS Order Types 
For events reported by ATSs, atsOrderType field is used to capture ATS-specific order types. The 
orderType and atsOrderType fields are not mutually exclusive; ATSs must populate both fields on 
applicable events. Industry Members that are not ATSs must leave the atsOrderType field blank. 
ATSs must register their order types with CAT at least 20 business days prior to the order type becoming 
effective using the CAT Reporter Portal. An order type must be registered before any relevant CAT     
Version 4.1.0 r4  37 
events can be submitted. An ATS Order Type Identifier shall not be required for market and limit orders 
that have no other special handling instructions that dictate how the order is handled within the ATS. 
Specific instructions for registering atsOrderTypes are available in CAT Alert 2019-01.  
3.1.3. Sequence Number 
ATSs must also provide a sequence number assigned by the ATS’s matching engine on all events 
reported to CAT by the ATS. Industry Members that are not ATSs are not required to populate the 
seqNum field. 
3.1.4. Display and Non-Display ATSs 
ATSs are required to populate the atsDisplayInd indicating if the order is displayed outside of the ATS to 
subscribers only, or via publicly disseminated quotation data. If the order is displayed ( atsDisplayInd = ‘S’, 
‘Y’, or ‘A’), the ATS is required to populate both the displayPrice and displayQty fields indicating the price 
and quantity at which the order was displayed. If the order is not displayed (atsDisplayInd = ‘N’), the ATS 
is required to populate the displayPrice and displayQty fields with a value of ‘0’. Industry Members that 
are not ATSs must leave the atsDisplayInd, displayPrice, and displayQty fields blank. 
3.1.5. CAT Reporter IMID 
When reporting to CAT, Industry Members operating an ATS must populate the CATReporterIMID using 
their FINRA assigned ATS MPID.  
3.2. Manual Orders 
The CAT NMS Plan defines a Manual Order Event as “non-electronic communication of order-related 
information for which CAT Reporters must record and report the time of the event.” Manual CAT events 
must be marked as a manual event using the manualFlag field and must include an electronic capture 
time if the manual event is captured in an order management or execution system.  
Proprietary orders (both equities and options) that are simultaneously entered into an OMS/EMS upon 
origination are always considered electronic.  
3.2.1. Manually Received CAT Events Immediately Systematized 
Orders which are non-electronically communicated but immediately systematized (e.g., a broker received 
a call and directly enters the order into the order management system) must be marked as a manual 
event using the manualFlag. In this scenario, the Industry Member is required to report both the manual     
Version 4.1.0 r4  38 
time of order receipt and the electronic capture time, and the same timestamp must be reported in both 
fields in milliseconds. 9  
Orders which are received or routed via instant message (IM) or email are considered manual events. 
Refer to CAT FAQ C7 for additional information.  
Refer to Section G of the CAT FAQs for additional information on manual orders. 
3.2.2. Manual CAT Events Followed by Separate Electronic Messages 
If an Industry Member routes or receives an order manually and then subsequently sends or receives an 
electronic message to represent the manual instruction, the following reporting requirements apply: 
• All material terms and conditions of a manually received or routed order, including time of route 
and receipt, must be reported to CAT on the required manual event, with all relevant timestamps 
representing when the manual CAT event occurred. 
• Additional electronic messages related to a manual order or route that do not change any 
material term or condition of the original order are not required to be reported to CAT as they 
represent a duplicate of the original order.  
• If the duplicate electronic message includes a routed order identifier that could be used to link the 
sender’s route report to the receiver’s new order, and the member has the ability to include this 
electronic information on the manual event (referred to as a “merged” event), the Industry 
Member must do so.  
• If the Industry Member is not able to merge the manual and electronic information in a single 
manual event and elects to report the duplicate electronic message independently, such 
messages must be reported with the electronicDupFlag populated as ‘true’, and the manualFlag 
populated as ‘false’. Further, the manualOrderID must be populated with the orderID of the 
original manual order.  
3.2.3. Manual Trade events and Order Fulfillment events 
Trade events and Order Fulfillment events must be marked as either manual or electronic using the 
manualFlag field.  
 
 
9 Refer to CAT FAQ G4 for additional information.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  39 
A Trade event is considered manual when the trade is executed outside of an OMS/EMS and must be 
manually entered before it can be trade reported. The time of execution populated in the eventTimestamp 
field is the time all terms and conditions were agreed to between the two parties, consistent with SRO and 
SEC rules.  
An Order Fulfillment event is considered manual if the fill of the customer/client order occurred outside of 
an OMS/EMS and was manually entered into an electronic system. The fulfillment time populated in the 
eventTimestamp field would be the time the firm gave the fill to the order. If a trader manually “drags and 
drops” or “clicks” in an OMS to fill an order, the time of the trader’s action would be the fulfillment time, 
and the Order Fulfillment event could be considered either manual or electronic.  
3.3. Allocation Events 
3.3.1. Definition and Requirements 
The CAT NMS Plan defines an Allocation Report as “a report made to the Central Repository by an 
Industry Member that identifies the Firm Designated ID for any account(s), including subaccount(s), to 
which executed shares are allocated”. This includes the placement of shares/contracts into the same 
account for which an order was originally placed, and the placement of shares/contracts into an account 
based on allocation instructions (e.g., subaccount allocations). In accordance with the CAT NMS Plan, 
allocation events are not required to be linked to particular orders or executions . 
Allocation events must be reported to CAT for all allocations to a customer  account, including DVP/RVP 
account allocations. Allocations to accounts other than a customer account (e.g., proprietary accounts, 
step outs, correspondent flips) may optionally be reported to CAT, but must be appropriately marked in 
the allocationType field.  
3.3.2. Reporting Obligation 
The CAT reporting obligation for allocation events is separate and distinct from other CAT events defined 
in this document. While the CAT reporting obligation for other CAT events belongs to the firm receiving or 
originating the order, the CAT reporting obligation for allocation events belongs to the firm performing the 
allocation, which is generally the clearing or self-clearing firm processing the allocation. 
The firm with the reporting obligation for New Order events must register the FDIDs it uses for new order 
reporting, and the firm with the reporting obligation for allocation events report must register the FDIDs it 
uses for allocation reporting.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  40 
3.3.3. Cancelling an Allocation 
The cancellation of an allocation can be reported to CAT using the cancelFlag and cancelTimestamp in 
the MEPA/MOPA event, or the MEAA/MOAA event. If the cancellation is reported using the MEPA/MOPA 
event, the eventTimestamp must reflect the date/time that the allocation was processed, and the 
cancelTimestamp must reflect the time that the allocation was cancelled. If the cancellation cannot be 
captured in the original MEPA/MOPA event, it must be captured in a correction to the MEPA/MOPA event. 
Corrections reflecting the cancellation of an allocation event on a subsequent day will not be marked late 
by CAT. 
If the cancellation is reported using the MEAA/MOAA event, the cancel information may be captured on 
the last Amended Allocation event reported to CAT using the same method described above. The cancel 
information may also be captured by reporting a ‘NEW’ event reflecting an update to the status of the 
allocation, showing that the allocation is now cancelled. The eventTimestamp and the cancelTimestamp 
in this scenario would both reflect the time that the allocation was cancelled.  
The cancellation of an amendment without cancelling the allocation itself is reported using a new 
MEAA/MOAA event and is not reflected using the cancelFlag and cancelTimestamp. Refer to the CAT 
Industry Member Reporting Scenarios document for detailed examples of how allocation amendments 
and cancellations must be reported to CAT. 
3.4. Responses to RFQs and Solicitation 
3.4.1. Scope 
While Industry Members are not required to report Requests for Quotes (“RFQs”) or Indications of 
Interests (“IOIs”) to CAT, Industry Members are required to report responses to RFQs and other forms of 
solicitation that are firm expressions of interest to trade10  falling within he definition of an “order” under 
 
 
10 Beginning August 1, 2026, all RFQ responses that are communicated in standard electronic format directly to an Industry 
Member’s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not “immediately actionable” (i.e., further action is required before a trade 
can be executed/routed), to the extent such responses are considered “orders” reportable pursuant to Rule 613(j)(8), will be 
required to be reported to CAT. On May 20, 2024, the SEC announced an order Granting a Temporary Conditional Exemption 
Pursuant to Section 36(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 608(e) of Regulation NMS Under 
the Exchange Act, Relating to the Reporting of Responses to Requests for Quotes and Other Solicitation Responses Provided in a 
 
     
Version 4.1.0 r4  41 
Rule 613(j)(8) of Regulation NMS of the Exchange Act, the CAT NMS Plan and the Compliance Rules, as 
described in CAT FAQ B45 and CAT FAQ C8. 
Industry Members are required to report all responses communicated directly to an Industry Member’s 
OMS/EMS in standard electronic format (e.g., FIX) that are immediately actionable, where no further 
action is required in order to route/execute the order. Such responses are reportable by both the CAT 
Reporter responding to the RFQ solicitation (“the Responder”) and the CAT Reporter receiving the 
response (“the Solicitor”), including responses that were not ultimately selected, and the solicitationFlag 
must be populated as ‘true’ by both parties. These requirements apply to equities, options, and multi-leg 
activities.  
Manual RFQ responses are considered manual/verbal, and in accordance with the November 12, 2020 
Exemptive Order filed by the SEC11, in Phase 2c/2d, Industry Members are not required to report any 
manual responses/receipts. However, manual/verbal responses are expected to become reportable in 
future phases of CAT, as this temporary exemptive relief expires on July 31, 2026. 12 
Industry Members are not required to report the following types of activities in Phases 2c/2d:  
• Responses not communicated in standard electronic format (e.g., phone call, IM/chat). 
• Responses that are communicated in standard electronic format directly to an Industry Member’s 
OMS/EMS with an understanding that further action is required before a trade can be 
executed/routed (not immediately actionable). 
 
 
Standard Electronic Format that is not “immediately actionable” (i.e., further action is required by the responder providing the quote 
in order to execute or cause a trade to be executed) (“NIA Electronic RFQ Responses”), as Required by Section 6.4(d) of the 
National Market System Plan Governing the Consolidated Audit Trail to the extent such responses are considered “orders” 
reportable pursuant to Rule 613(j)(8), from August 1, 2024 to August 1, 2026. 
11 https://www.sec.gov/rules/exorders/2020/34-90405.pdf 
12 On March 31, 2023, the Plan Participants filed a request for exemptive relief requesting an extension of the exemptive relief 
regarding the reporting of certain verbal floor activity and unstructured verbal and electronic upstairs activity through July 31, 2026. 
On July 28, 2023, the Commission extended the temporary relief granted in the 2020 Order for an additional three years, to July 31, 
2026.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  42 
However, once a winning bid(s) has been selected, any subsequent reportable activity must be reported 
to CAT. Once an order is generated as a result of the winning response, the order is required to be 
reported by the party sending the order and the party receiving the order. This includes scenarios where 
the Solicitor is required to send an order to the Responder after selection of the winning bid, or where the 
Responder is required to send an order to the Solicitor after selection of the winning bid.  
The solicitationFlag must not be populated as ‘true’ on any events that occur after selection of the winning 
bid. For example, if a solicitation response is provided manually and is not reportable to CAT in Phase 2d, 
the order originated as a result of solicitation after the selection of the winning bid must reflect the 
solicitationFlag as ‘false’. If a solicitation response is provided electronically and is reportable to CAT in 
Phase 2d, the events reflecting the response must reflect the solicitationFlag as ‘true’. Any events that 
occur after the selection of the winning bid must reflect the solicitationFlag as ‘false’. Refer to the CAT 
Industry Member Reporting Scenarios document for specific examples of how RFQ and Solicitation 
Response flow should be reported to CAT.

Version 4.1.0 r4  43 
Industry Members Operating RFQ Platforms 
Industry Members that provide RFQ platforms to other Industry Members generally are required to report 
CAT information for responses sent through these platforms (as they themselves would be considered 
the Responder/Solicitor), except under the following circumstances:  
1. The Industry Member providing the RFQ platform is doing so solely in a technology vendor 
capacity and not as a broker-dealer (e.g., the Industry Member has no involvement relating to 
the solicitations or responses other than providing the solicitation mechanism technology);   
2. The Solicitor must have a direct relationship with the Responders and understands that the 
Industry Member providing the RFQ platform is doing so solely in a technology vendor 
capacity and not as a broker-dealer; and  
3. Responders view solicitations as coming directly from the Solicitor and not the Industry 
Member providing the RFQ platform, for all purposes, including, but not limited to, CAT 
reporting, trade reporting, applicable fees, etc.  
3.4.2. Reporting 
If an RFQ or solicitation response was provided as an order, the responder must report its response to 
CAT using a New Order event and Order Route event to the solicitor. The solicitor must report the receipt 
of each response using an Order Accepted event. 
If an RFQ or solicitation response was provided as a quote, the response would be reported to CAT using 
quote events. However, FINRA CAT is unaware of any workflows involving an immediately actionable 
quote message.  
Industry Members are not required to report cancellation events for responses to an RFQ or solicitation 
that were ultimately not selected if the solicitationFlag is correctly populated as ‘true’.  
3.5. Stop Orders 
3.5.1. Stop Loss Orders 
When reporting stop loss orders to CAT, Industry Members must indicate the type of stop loss order that 
was received/originated or routed through a combination of the handlingInstructions and orderType fields.  
The handlingInstructions value of ‘STOP’ is a Name/Value Pair that denotes the stop price and requires a 
numeric value representing the stop price (e.g., STOP=1.00). In instances where it is known that the 
order is a stop order, but the exact stop price is unknown because it is either based on an underlying     
Version 4.1.0 r4  44 
condition or will be determined by the destination venue, Industry Members may populate a 
handlingInstructions value of ‘STOPF’.  
When reporting handlingInstructions values of ‘SOQ’ (Stop on Quote) or ‘SLQ’ (Stop Limit on Quote), the 
‘STOP’ instruction must be reported in addition to these values to indicate the stop price on the order if it 
is known. 
The orderType field for orders received/originated or routed as Stop orders must be populated as ‘MKT’, 
and the orderType field for orders received/originated or routed as Stop Limit orders must be populated 
as ‘LMT’. Refer to Table 14 below for additional information.  
Table 14: Reporting Requirements for Stop Orders 
Type of Stop Order Description orderType handlingInstructions 
Stop An order that is triggered by the last sale price at 
which point the stopped order becomes a market 
order. 
MKT STOP=1.00 (or STOPF if 
the price is not known) 
Stop Limit An order that is triggered by the last sale price at 
which point the stopped order becomes a limit order. 
LMT STOP=1.00 (or STOPF if 
the price is not known) 
Stop on Quote An order that is triggered by a quotation at which 
point the stopped order becomes a market order. 
MKT STOP=1.00 (or STOPF if 
the price is not known) 
and SOQ 
Stop Limit on Quote An order that is triggered by a quotation at which 
point the stopped order becomes a limit order. 
LMT STOP=1.00 (or STOPF if 
the price is not known) 
and SLQ 
Trailing Stop An order that allows the stop price to increase (or 
decrease) by a predetermined amount or formula 
(e.g., a specified dollar amount, a percentage of the 
market price, or some other predetermined criteria) 
as the market price of the security advances (or 
declines). Once triggered, stopped order becomes a 
market order. 
 
Refer to CAT FAQ B61 for additional information. 
MKT TS 
Trailing Stop Limit An order that allows the stop price to increase (or 
decrease) by a predetermined amount or formula 
(e.g., a specified dollar amount, a percentage of the 
market price, or some other predetermined criteria) 
as the market price of the security advances (or 
declines). Once triggered, stopped order becomes a 
limit order. 
 
Refer to CAT FAQ B61 for additional information. 
LMT TS 
 
In addition to reporting the receipt or origination of the order with applicable handlingInstructions , Industry 
Members are required to report an Order Effective event (MEOE, MOOE, or MLOE, as applicable) when 
all underlying conditions of an order (e.g., the Stop) are met, and the order becomes and remains 
effective until it is fully executed or cancelled. The party that was holding the order at the time the order or 
underlying condition became effective has the obligation to report to CAT the Order Effective event. In     
Version 4.1.0 r4  45 
scenarios where the trigger price was not explicitly captured in the handlingInstructions  field on the 
related new order (e.g., Stop Formula, Trailing Stop), the triggerPrice field must be populated on the 
Order Effective event.  
Refer to the CAT Industry Member Reporting Scenarios document for specific examples of how these 
orders should be reported to CAT. 
3.5.2. Stop Stock Orders 
When reporting stop stock orders to CAT, Industry Members are required to report the 
‘SW’ handlingInstructions indicating that the transaction resulted from an order for which a member and 
another party agreed that the order will be executed at stop stock price or better. The ‘SW’ 
handlingInstructions value must be paired with the stop stock price that is greater than zero (e.g., 
SW=35.00).  
For stop stock orders where the entire shares quantity of the order is not being stopped, 
the handlingInstructions field must also be populated with a value of ‘SWQ’ paired with a quantity value 
that is greater than zero representing the number of shares being stopped (e.g., SWQ=100). When 
a handlingInstructions value of ‘SWQ’ is populated, the value of ‘SW’ paired with the stop stock price 
must also be populated, otherwise the record will reject for invalid handlingInstructions. 
An MEOE event is not required when reporting stop stock transactions to CAT. Refer to the CAT Industry 
Member Reporting Scenarios document for specific examples of how these orders should be reported to 
CAT. 
3.6. Conditional Orders 
When reporting conditional orders to CAT, Industry Members must indicate if the order is contingent on 
the execution of another order using handlingInstructions value ‘CND’, or if the order is contingent on the 
occurrence of a market condition using handlingInstructions value ‘CMC’ (e.g., once symbol ABCD trades 
X# of shares, the order becomes executable). Industry Members may populate both values if applicable 
to the order. 
In addition to reporting the receipt or origination of the conditional order with applicable 
handlingInstructions, Industry Members are required to report an Order Effective event (MEOE, MOOE, or 
MLOE, as applicable) when all underlying conditions of the order are met and the order remains effective 
until it is fully executed or cancelled. The party that was holding the order at the time the order or 
underlying condition became effective has the obligation to report to CAT the Order Effective event.  The     
Version 4.1.0 r4  46 
triggerPrice field is not required to be reported on Order Effective events for orders that are conditional on 
another order, a market condition, or a spread condition. 
When determining if the ‘CND’ or ‘CMC’ handlingInstructions must be populated, Industry Members must 
consider the date and time the firm determines it has received/originated an order in its books and 
records. A conditional order becomes reportable once it is firmed up/confirmed. The time of 
receipt/origination for the sender would be the time the order was firmed up/confirmed by the sender, and 
the time of receipt for the receiver would be the time the firmed up/confirmed order is received from the 
sender. Refer to CAT FAQ B40 for additional information. 
The ‘CND’ and ‘CMC’ handlingInstructions value must only be used in instances where an order is 
received and cannot be actioned because it does not become effective until the underlying condition is 
met. If the Industry Member does not consider an order to be received until the underlying condition is 
met and the order has become effective, then the guidance relating to the ‘CND’/‘CMC’ 
handlingInstructions and Order Effective event would not apply, as the order would be considered 
effective upon receipt/origination. In this scenario, a New Order event must be reported to CAT reflecting 
the terms and conditions of the order that were applicable upon receipt, and the ‘ CND’/‘CMC’ 
handlingInstructions must not be populated. 
If the Industry Member receives an order that can be immediately actioned upon receipt, but the order 
also has underlying conditions that will change the material terms of the order when the conditions are 
met, then the guidance relating to the ‘CND’/‘CMC’ handlingInstructions and Order Effective event would 
not apply, as the order would be considered effective upon receipt. In this scenario, a New Order event 
must be reported to CAT reflecting the terms and conditions of the order that were applicable upon 
receipt, and the ‘CND’/‘CMC’ handlingInstructions must not be populated. Any changes to the material 
terms of the order that occur as the result of an underlying condition must be reported as an Order 
Modified event. 
If the Industry Member receives an order with a condition that may cause the order to become active or 
inactive multiple times throughout the day, the Industry Member must populate a value of ‘CSC’ 
(Contingent on Spread Condition) on its New Order event, and the Industry Member is not required to 
report an Order Effective or Order Modified event as the order becomes effective or ineffective throughout 
the day.  
3.7. Multi-Leg Option Orders and Paired Orders 
Paired Orders are defined for CAT reporting purposes as simple or multi-leg option orders that contain 
both the initial and contra side that are electronically routed to an exchange as a single message for 
crossing and/or price improvement. Orders routed as a pair must be reported to CAT, and all Option     
Version 4.1.0 r4  47 
Order Route and Multi-Leg Order Route events routed in the pair must be identified using a 
pairedOrderID. 
Paired Orders Do Not Include: 
• Orders that are not treated as a paired order by the exchange such as “post and wait” 
• Preferenced or directed orders that that do not contain both the buy side and the sell side  
• Orders routed to another Industry Member, such as a Floor Broker 
Multi-Leg orders must be reported using Multi-Leg Order events as defined in Section 5.2. 
3.8. Orders Tied at a Net Price 
If an equity order is tied to stock, fixed income, futures, or another product that is not reportable to CAT at 
a net price (or other formula such as a specific delta), Industry Members must populate the netPrice and 
the appropriate handlingInstructions value of ‘TTS’, ‘TTF’, ‘TTO’, ‘TTU’, or ‘FUT’. This activity does not 
meet the definition of a multi-leg order, as these trading strategies do not contain an option leg. 
If a simple equity is tied to a simple option at a net price (or other formula such as a specific delta) as part 
of a pairs trading strategy that does not meet the definition of a multi-leg order, the equity order must 
contain a handlingInstructions value of ‘TTSO’, and the option must contain a handlingInstructions value 
of ‘TTS’.  
If a single, simple option order is tied to futures, fixed income, or another product that is not reportable to 
CAT, Industry Members must populate the appropriate handlingInstructions values of ‘TTF’, ‘TTO’, or 
‘FUT’. 
Industry Members are required to populate the netPrice field on equity or simple option order events if the 
order is tied to stock, fixed income, futures, or another product that is not reportable to CAT , at a net price. 
The netPrice field is not required to be populated if the order is tied to another formula, such as a specific 
delta. However, the relevant handlingInstructions value is required to be populated. 
The handlingInstructions values ‘TTS’ and ‘TTSO’ are not required to be captured on multi-leg order 
events. Refer to CAT FAQ B71 for additional information.  
3.9. Percentage Based Prices 
There are cases where the price of an order is specified as a percentage of a price to be determined at a 
future time – e.g., closing price of the underlying security. Percentage-based order prices are most 
common with FLEXPCT options, but could potentially be provided with other securities.       
Version 4.1.0 r4  48 
If an Industry Member receives or originates an order where the price is specified as a percentage of a 
benchmark price, the Industry Member is required to report the percentage-based price in the price field 
and report the ‘PCTPX’ value in the handlingInstructions field. For example, an Industry Member receives 
an order to Buy 100 %1ABCD 251231C00100000 with a limit price of 4.75% of the closing price of stock 
ABCD. The order events would be reported to CAT with 4.75 populated in the price field and the ‘PCTPX’ 
value populated in the handlingInstructions field. At the end of the trading day, stock ABDC closes at 16.  
The final symbol of the FLEX option is 1ABCD 251231C00016000 (100% of the $16 closing price of 
ABCD as the strike price of the FLEX option) and the final trade price is $0.76 (4.75% of the $16 closing 
price of ABCD as the trade price), which are reported to CAT by the exchange. 
orderType price  optionID handlingInstructions 
LMT 4.75  %1ABCD 251231C00100000 PCTPX 
 
Please note that the example above of percentage-based order price includes a FLEXPCT option, 
because this is the most common scenario. However, an Industry Member may receive an order in a 
FLEXPCT option with a dollar limit price (e.g., $0.75).  In this case, ‘0.75’ would be specified in the price 
field and the ‘PCTPX’ handlingInstructions value would not be appropriate.   
orderType price  optionID handlingInstructions 
LMT 0.75  %1ABCD 251231C00100000 
 
 
Likewise, a percentage-based price (4.75%) could be provided on an order for a security that is not a 
FLEXPCT option (e.g., 1ABCD 251231C00015950). In this case, the price reporting above would still 
apply.

4.1. New Order Event 
New Order events represent the beginning of the order lifecycle in CAT. An Industry Member must report 
a New Order event to CAT when an order is received or originated including:  
• New customer orders  
• Representative orders 
• Proprietary orders 
• Order(s) received from a foreign broker-dealer or affiliate that is not a CAT Reporter. 
An order received from another CAT Reporter (US broker-dealer, ATS or an exchange) must be reported 
as an Order Accepted event.  
Representative Orders 
Industry Members are required to link representative street-side orders with the related customer order or 
client order being represented. The Industry Member must report a New Order event for the creation of 
the representative order, and populate the representativeInd field to indicate that it is a representative 
order. The Industry Member must also populate the aggregatedOrders field linking the representative 
order to the underlying orders. 
Appendix C contains detailed descriptions of representative order scenarios and illustrates when marking 
of the representative order, linkage between the represented order and the representative order, and 
Order Fulfillment linkage is required.

4.2. New Order Supplement Event 
The New Order Supplement event is a supplement to the New Order event. One New Order event can 
have multiple New Order Supplement events. Multiple New Order Supplement events are considered as 
additions, not replacements or modifications. This event accommodates reporting in the following 
scenarios:  
Aggregated Orders 
This event accommodates reporting in scenarios when the number of Aggregated Orders included in the 
aggregatedOrders field causes the New Order event to exceed the maximum allowed message length, or 
when the orders being represented are not captured in the New Order Event. The aggregatedOrders field 
in the New Order Supplement event must contain the additional Aggregated Orders that were not 
captured in the original New Order event, or another Supplement event for the same order.  
FDID 
This event accommodates reporting in scenarios when an Industry Member receives an order for a new 
account and the new account number, on which the FDID is based, is not yet available for creation and 
reporting of the CAT new order event. If an FDID has not yet been created when an order has been 
received, the Industry Member must populate the firmDesignatedID field in its New Order event with a 
value of ‘PENDING’.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  56 
Once the FDID becomes available, the Industry Member must report the actual FDID in the 
firmDesignatedID field in a New Order Supplement event. Any New Order Supplement event with an 
FDID populated will not be considered late for CAT reporting purposes if it is received by T+3 @ 8 :00 AM 
ET. Refer to the CAT CAIS Industry Member Reporting Scenarios for additional information on how the 
firmDesignatedID will be reflected in the CAIS.

4.3. Order Route Event 
Industry Members are required to report an Order Route event to CAT in the following scenarios when an 
order is routed in full or in part: 
• Routing to another Industry Member 
• Routing to foreign broker-dealers 
• Routing to exchanges 
• Routing between two IMIDs (e.g., two different FINRA MPIDs) attributed to the same legal entity 
(i.e., the same CRD).  
 
When routing between two IMIDs of the same legal entity, the affiliateFlag must be populated as ‘true’ in 
accordance with CAT FAQ E27. Internal routes to another desk or department within an Industry Member 
are reported using an Order Internal Route Accepted event. Refer to the Order Internal Route Accepted  
section for more details. 
Handling Instructions on Order Route Events 
Handling Instructions are required to be reported on the Order Route event. The handling instructions 
included in this event must represent the handling instructions sent by the routing firm to the receiving 
destination. If the handling instructions do not change when the order is routed externally from the 
handling instructions received by the Industry Member and reported on the Order Accepted or New Order     
Version 4.1.0 r4  58 
event associated with the order, Industry Members may use the handlingInstructions value ‘RAR’ (Routed 
as Received) instead of repeating each individual handling instruction.

4.3.2. Route Cancelled Event 
Industry Members must report a Route Cancelled event to CAT when a route has been fully or partially 
cancelled. Partial cancellations of a route may be reported to CAT using a Route Cancelled event or a 
Route Modified event. However, when routing between Industry Members, both parties must 
communicate and use the same method to report to CAT. If one party reports to CAT using the 
cancellation method and the other party reports to CAT using a modification method, this will result in 
unlinked records that must be resolved. 
The routedOrderID of the Order Route event being cancelled must be reflected in the Route Cancelled 
event. If a route cancellation request is rejected by the destination venue, the Route Cancelled event 
must be reported with a routeRejectedFlag of ‘true’.

4.5. Order Internal Route Accepted 
An Order Internal Route Accepted event must be reported when an order is passed to a different 
department or desk within the CATReporterIMID. Routes between different IMIDs attributed to the same 
Industry Member must be reported as Order Route and Order Accepted events.  
An Order Internal Route Accepted event is required to be reported from the perspective of the recipient 
desk, and indicates that an order was received by an internal destination. In Phase 2d, Industry Members 
may choose to assign a new Order Key to an Order Internal Route Accepted event. If a new orderID is 
assigned, the parentOrderID must be populated with the orderID of the event that was internally routed, 
and the parentOrderKeyDate must be populated.  
An Industry Member may generate child orders using the Child Order event prior to routing internally to 
another desk. This approach is acceptable for CAT reporting and will not result in unlinked events.

4.6. Child Order 
The Child Order is used to represent instances when an order is sliced within the desk or department it is 
being worked, and is assigned a new order identifier. While all CAT reportable activity must be reported to 
CAT in applicable phases, Child Order events are not required to be utilized for CAT reporting. These 
event types are for the convenience of Industry Members to help model these types of order handling 
scenarios. 
Child Order events are defined to include only the key data elements that may be changed when the 
event is created including fields to link to the parent order. The following rules apply with respect to Child 
Orders: 
• Child Order events can only be reported when new order IDs are assigned within the same desk. 
An Order Internal Route Accepted event must be reported when routed to another desk.  
• A child order may be generated off of another child order without limitation.  
• Child Order events must belong to the same FDID as the parent order. Child Orders must not be 
used to create representative orders. If the FDID changes, a representative New Order event 
must be reported and not a Child Order.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  88 
• Child Order events must not be used to represent a multi-leg option order being “legged out”. 
However, the Child Order event may be used in scenarios where an order is “legged out” and 
subsequently entered into another OMS/EMS or Algo within the same desk or department where 
a new orderID is assigned to each leg upon entry.

4.7. Order Modified (Cancel/Replace) Event 
Industry Members must report an Order Modified event to CAT when the Material Terms of an order have 
been changed (e.g., price, quantity) or when an order is cancel/replaced. All attributes and Material 
Terms of the modified order listed on this event must be restated with the modification(s) reflected. If the 
order is a representative order, the aggregatedOrders field must be restated every time the order is 
modified or cancel/replaced. Changes to the orders being represented in the aggregatedOrders field are 
considered a modification to the order. The side field is required to be reported, but side adjustments are 
only allowed for same-side changes, including changes between Short Sale and Sell Long.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  95 
If a modification results in the generation of new order with a new Order Key which replaces the prior 
order, the orderID field must capture the identifier for the new order, and the prior order fields must reflect 
the order that is being replaced. If the order has been modified more than once with a new orderID 
assigned with each modification, the priorOrderID must refer to orderID of the immediately preceding 
modification which will not be the original Order ID. If the orderID remains the same during the 
modification, the priorOrderID must remain blank. 
Industry Members are not required to report the modification request to CAT if the order is terminal (e.g., 
it has already been fully executed or cancelled) in Phase 2d. However, this activity may be required in 
future phases of CAT. If a modification request was received that was too late to modify, and the order 
was not terminal (e.g., the order was “in-flight” and there was no confirmation time), the request must be 
reported as an Order Modification Request event.

4.8. Order Adjusted Event 
An Order Adjusted event must be used when the display price or quantity changes as the result of a 
Display ATS matching engine action and not from a customer/client instruction. The Order Adjusted event 
may be used by non-ATS firms instead of an Order Modified event to report changes to the price or 
quantity of an order. 
The following rules apply: 
• If any of the price fields change, then all price fields (i.e., price, displayPrice, and workingPrice) must 
be reported to represent current state of the order relative to price. The quantity fields are not 
required.  
• If any of the quantity fields change, then all quantity fields (i.e., quantity, minQty, leavesQty, 
displayQty) must be reported to represent the current state of the order relative to quantity. The price 
fields are not required.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  105 
Any modification that cannot be fully represented in this Reportable Event must be reported via the Order 
Modified event. This includes modifications received from another Industry Member where a 
routedOrderID is required, and modifications to the orderType. 
Industry Members may assign a new Order Key to Order Adjusted events. If a unique orderID is assigned, 
the priorOrderID must be populated with the orderID of the order that is being adjusted, and the 
priorOrderKeyDate must be populated. If the order has been adjusted more than once, the priorOrderID 
must refer to orderID of the immediately preceding adjustment which will not be the original Order ID.

4.9. Order Cancelled Event 
The Order Cancelled event is reported when an order is fully or partially cancelled. Partial cancellations of 
an order may be reported to CAT using an Order Cancelled event or an Order Modified event. However, 
when routing between Industry Members, both parties must communicate and use the same method to 
report to CAT. If one party reports to CAT using the cancellation method and the other party reports to 
CAT using a modification method, this will result in unlinked records that must be resolved.  
 
Implicit order cancellations, such as cancellations due to expiration of Time in Force, are not required to 
be reported to CAT.  
 
Order Cancelled events are required to be reported by the entity that initiated the cancellation. When an 
Order is routed from Firm A to Firm B, the following rules apply: 
• If Firm A or its customer/client initiates the cancel, Firm A and Firm B must report the Order Cancelled 
event.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  108 
• If Firm B initiates the cancel, Firm B must report the Order Cancelled event. 
 
Industry Members are not required to report the cancel request to CAT if the order is terminal (e.g., it has 
already been fully executed or cancelled) in Phase 2d. However, this activity may be required in future 
phases of CAT. If a cancellation request was received that was too late to cancel, and the order was not 
terminal (e.g., the order was “in-flight” and there was no confirmation time), the request must be reported 
as an Order Cancel Request event.

4.10. Quotes 
Quote events are used to report electronic quotes and electronic RFQ responses communicated in 
standard electronic format (e.g., FIX) that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
under the definition of an “order” under Rule 613(j)(8), provided by or received in a CAT Reporter’s 
order/quote handling system, execution systems, or RFQ platform in CAT reportable securities and are 
provided by an Industry Member to other market participants off a national securities exchanges , as 
described in CAT FAQ B45. The following guidance applies to quotes in OTC Equity Securities and NMS 
Securities sent to an inter-dealer quotation system or electronic RFQ responses sent to an RFQ platform 
in standard electronic format that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT: 
• Quotes in OTC Equity Securities sent to an inter-dealer quotation system operated by an Industry 
Member must be reported using the New Quote event. 
• Quotes in OTC Equity Securities received by an Industry Member CAT Reporter operating an 
inter-dealer quotation system using the Quote Received event. 
• Quotes in OTC Equity Securities that meet the definition of bid or offer under the CAT NMS Plan 
sent by a broker-dealer to a quotation venue not operated by a CAT Reporter must be reported 
using the New Quote event. 
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
sent to an RFQ platform operated by an Industry Member must be reported using the New Quote 
event. 
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
received by an Industry Member CAT Reporter operating an RFQ platform using the Quote 
Received event. 
 
Quotes in NMS Securities sent to an exchange or a Display-Only Facility must also be reported using the 
New Order and Order Route events. 
On May 20, 2024, the SEC announced an order Granting a Temporary Conditional Exemption Pursuant 
to Section 36(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 608(e) of 
Regulation NMS Under the Exchange Act, Relating to the Reporting of Responses to Requests for 
Quotes and Other Solicitation Responses Provided in a Standard Electronic Format  that is not 
“immediately actionable” (i.e., further action is required by the responder providing the quote in order to 
execute or cause a trade to be executed) (“NIA Electronic RFQ Responses”), as Required by Section 
6.4(d) of the National Market System Plan Governing the Consolidated Audit Trail, to the extent such 
responses are considered “orders” reportable pursuant to Rule 613(j)(8), from August 1, 2024 to August 1, 
2026.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  112 
4.10.1. New Quote Event 
The New Quote Event is used to report the following: 
• Quotes originated in OTC equity securities ultimately sent to an inter-dealer quotation system 
operated by an Industry Member 
• Quotes originated in OTC Equity securities ultimately sent to a quotation venue not operated by 
a CAT Reporter.  
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
ultimately sent to an RFQ system operated by an Industry Member. 
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable, that need to be reported to CAT,  
ultimately sent to a Third Party RFQ Platform not operated by a CAT Reporter.  
• Any other electronic quotes which are provided by or received in a CAT Reporter’s order/quote 
handling or execution systems in CAT reportable securities and are provided by an Industry 
Member to other market participants off a national securities exchange, as described in CAT 
FAQ B45. 
• Quotes originated in NMS equity Securities for displaying on a Display-Only Facility. 
For two-sided quote events, the bidPrice, bidQty, askPrice and askQty fields must be populated. For one-
sided quote events, the price and quantity of the applicable side must be populated. For quotes 
representing a name only quote in an OTC Equity security for which a price and quantity is not applicable, 
the price and quantity of the applicable side must be blank or must be populated with zero, and the 
unpricedInd field must be populated as ‘true’. An unpriced quote generated to cancel and clear an 
existing two-sided quotation in NMS Security on a Display-Only Facility must include the unpricedInd field 
populated with ‘true’, and the bidPrice, bidQty, askPrice and askQty fields all populated with a value of 
zero. For quote events reported to CAT reflecting a response to an electronic RFQ, if the 
bidRelativePrice/askRelativePrice field is populated, the bidPrice and askPrice fields are not required to 
be populated. 
If the field onlyOneQuoteFlag is populated as ‘true’, any New Quote event offered by the same 
CATReporterIMID to the same destination in the same symbol will be considered cancelled and replaced 
by CAT. Modifications reflected using the onlyOneQuoteFlag method may maintain the same quote ID. 
However, if a quote is cancelled and a new quote is reported to CAT, the New Quote Event must not 
maintain the same quote ID as the quote that was cancelled. Modifications to a quote when the 
onlyOneQuoteFlag is populated as ‘true’ may alternatively be captured using the Quote Modified event.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  113 
Quotes entered directly into an inter-dealer quotation system’s platform that are not sent to the inter-
dealer quotation system electronically (e.g., via FIX) are considered to be originated manually, and the 
manualFlag must be populated as ‘true’.

4.10.3. Routed Quote Event 
The Routed Quote Event is used to report the following: 
• Quotes in OTC equity securities sent to an inter-dealer quotation system or operated by an 
Industry Member 
• Quotes in OTC Equity securities sent to a quotation venue not operated by a CAT Reporter .  
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
sent to an RFQ platform operated by an Industry Member 
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
sent to an RFQ platform not operated by a CAT Reporter. 
• Any other route of electronic quotes which are provided by or received in a CAT Reporter’s 
order/quote handling or execution systems in CAT reportable securities and are provided by an 
Industry Member to other market participants off a national securities exchanges , as described in 
CAT FAQ B45. 
• Quotes originated in NMS equity Securities for displaying on a Display-Only Facility. 
For two-sided quote events, the bidPrice, bidQty, askPrice and askQty fields must be populated. For one-
sided quote events, the price and quantity of the applicable side must be populated. For quotes 
representing a name only quote in an OTC Equity security for which a price and quantity is not applicable, 
the price and quantity of the applicable side must be blank or must be populated with zero, and the 
unpricedInd field must be populated as ‘true’. An unpriced quote generated to cancel and clear an 
existing two-sided quotation in NMS Security on a Display-Only Facility must include the unpricedInd field 
populated with ‘true’, and the bidPrice, bidQty, askPrice and askQty fields all populated with a value of 
zero. For quote events reported to CAT reflecting a response to an electronic RFQ, if the bidRelativePrice 
/ askRelativePrice field is populated, the bidPrice and askPrice fields are not required to be populated. 
Quotes entered directly into an inter-dealer quotation system’s platform that are not sent to the inter-
dealer quotation system electronically (e.g., via FIX) are considered to be routed manually, and the 
manualFlag must be populated as ‘true’. The routedQuoteID field is not required for manual routes.

4.10.4. Routed Quote Supplement Event 
The Routed Quote Supplement Event is a supplement to the Routed Quote event. Routed Quote 
Supplement events are  considered as additions to a Routed Quote event, not replacements or 
modifications. This event accommodates reporting in scenarios where a quote route is rejected by the 
venue to which it was routed, and the Industry Member chooses to report the quoteRejectedFlag in this 
separate Routed Quote Supplement event. 
This event is required only when an Industry Member is generating quotes and displaying them on a 
Display-only Facility.

4.10.5. Quote Received/Replace Event 
The Quote Received event is used to report New Quotes in OTC Equity and NMS Securities received by 
an Industry Member inter-dealer quotation system, and to update and replace an existing RFQ response.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  125 
For two-sided quote events, the bidPrice, bidQty, askPrice and askQty fields must be populated. For one-
sided quote events, the price and quantity of the applicable side must be populated. For quotes 
representing a name only quote for which a price and quantity is not applicable, the price and quantity of 
the applicable side must be blank or must be populated with zero, and the unpricedInd must be populated 
as ‘true’. For quote events reported to CAT reflecting a response to an electronic RFQ, if the 
bidRelativePrice / askRelativePrice field is populated, the bidPrice and askPrice fields are not required to 
be populated. 
If the field onlyOneQuoteFlag is populated as ‘true’, any Quote Received event offered by the same 
CATReporterIMID from the same senderIMID in the same symbol will be considered cancelled and 
replaced by CAT. Modifications reflected using the onlyOneQuoteFlag method may maintain the same 
quote ID. However, if a quote is cancelled and a new quote is reported to CAT, the Quote Received Event 
must not maintain the same quote ID as the quote that was cancelled. Modifications to a quote when the 
onlyOneQuoteFlag is populated as ‘true’ may alternatively be captured using the Quote Modified event.  
Quotes entered directly into an inter-dealer quotation system’s platform that are not sent to the inter-
dealer quotation system electronically (e.g., via FIX) are considered to be received manually, and the 
manualFlag must be populated as ‘true’. The routedQuoteID field is not required for manual routes.

4.10.6. Quote Cancelled Event 
If a quote is cancelled that was sent to by an Industry Member to an Industry Member inter-dealer 
quotation system, then both the sender of the quote and the inter-dealer quotation system that accepted 
the quote must report Quote Cancelled events. If an RFQ Response (not immediately actionable) is 
cancelled that was sent to by an Industry Member to an Industry Member operating an RFQ platform  or a 
quotation venue not operated by a CAT Reporter, then the sender of the RFQ Response must report 
Quote Cancelled events. 
Orders cancelled directly in an inter-dealer quotation system’s platform that are not sent to the inter-
dealer quotation system electronically (e.g., via FIX) are considered to be cancelled manually, and the 
manualFlag must be populated as ‘true’.

4.11. Trade 
A Trade Event is used when the Industry Member acts as the executing broker and is required to report 
the trade for public dissemination purposes. When an Industry Member is not required to report the 
execution of a customer/client order for public dissemination purposes, with the exceptions noted below, 
an Order Fulfillment event must be used. See Section 4.12 Order Fulfillment for more details. 
Reporting Exception Codes 
In general, Trade events are required to match to a TRF/ORF/ADF report. However, t here are four 
circumstances when an MEOT would not be able to be linked to a TRF report and a Reporting Exception 
Code (REC) is required on a Trade event to allow the Processor to identify that there will be no link to a 
TRF/ORF/ADF report:     
Version 4.1.0 r4  136 
• An Industry Member executes a trade between two desks or departments of the same firm, but 
because there is no change in beneficial ownership, no trade is reported for public dissemination. 
In this instance a REC of “P” should be used on the Trade event.  
• An Industry Member executes a trade and must report the trade via Form T. In this instance,  a 
REC of “F” should be used on the Trade event. 
• A trade was executed by a non-FINRA member firm and was reported to the TRF by the FINRA 
member counterparty. In this instance, the non-FINRA member must populate a REC of “N” on 
the Trade event. 
• Industry Member was the contra side of the trade report which was reported to a TRF/ORF/ADF 
via a QSR or AGU, and was therefore unable to populate a tapeTradeID. In this instance, a REC 
of ‘C’ should be used on the Trade event to reflect a linkage to the related TRF/ORF/ADF report 
could not be made. The following rules apply when REC ‘C’ is used: 
 The marketCenterID field must be populated. 
 The clearingFirm and counterparty fields must be populated.  
 The cancelFlag and cancelTimestamp must be populated accordingly for all trades that are 
reported to a TRF via a QSR or AGU and later cancelled, as the CAT would not be able to 
link to a related TRF cancellation. 
FINRA CAT will closely monitor all uses of REC ‘C’ to ensure compliance with the above noted 
guidelines.  
 
Trade Side Details 
Trade events are two-sided, containing information on both sides of the trade. Exceptions requiring only 
one side of the Trade event to be populated are noted below. The details of each side are reported using 
Trade Side Details. The data type Trade Side Details is described as a list of fields in  Table 49 below. 
Trade Side Details must contain only one orderID per side. The buyDetails must contain the orderID of 
the buy side of the trade and the sellDetails must contain the orderID of the sell side of the trade. If there 
is more than one orderID associated with one side of the trade, the Trade Side Details related to each 
orderID must be populated in a separate Trade Supplement event.  
Internalized Trade 
When an Industry Member internalizes an order by filling it from a proprietary account, the Industry 
Member must report the orderID on the customer/client side and the FDID and the accountHolderType of 
the proprietary account on the firm side. In this scenario, no orderID is required on the firm side of the 
Trade event. The capacity field on the trade event must be ‘P’ for Principal reflecting the capacity in which 
the Industry Member acted.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  137 
However, if the Industry Member generates a proprietary order to facilitate the execution of the 
customer/client order, the Industry Member must report the orderID of both the customer/client side and 
the firm side of the Trade event. Refer to CAT FAQ B41 for additional information. 
One-Sided Trade events 
There are several exceptions which only require one side of a Trade event to be populated. These 
exceptions include: 
• Trade is executed as the result of a negotiation between two Industry Members.  
• Order is routed by a FINRA Member to a non-FINRA member, and the FINRA Member has the 
obligation to submit a media trade report to a TRF/ADF/ORF.  
• Order is routed by an Industry Member to a foreign broker-dealer, and the foreign broker-dealer 
executes the order at a net price, creating a media trade reporting obligation in the United States.  
In these scenarios, each party that is required to report a Trade event to CAT must populate the 
sideDetailsInd indicating which side of the trade the Industry Member was associated with, and which 
Trade Side Details will be populated in the Trade event. 
Cancelled Trades 
In accordance with CAT FAQ E25, the cancelFlag must be set to true only in instances when a trade is 
cancelled because the trade report is rejected by the TRF/ORF or ADF. For all instances where a trade is 
reported to, and accepted by, the TRF/ORF or ADF, including those that are cancelled or busted in the 
trade reporting data, the cancelFlag must be set to false. Refer to CAT FAQ E29 and CAT FAQ E30 for 
additional information.

4.12. Order Fulfillment  
The Order Fulfillment event is used to report the execution of a customer/client order that is not required 
to be reported for public dissemination purposes.  
Order Fulfillment events are required in scenarios where: 
• A representative order was used to facilitate the execution of the customer/client order.  
• An order is routed to a foreign market and the resulting foreign execution is not captured by CAT.  
The Order Fulfillment event is designed to capture the customer/client details and the firm side details. 
Firm side details provide linkage to the representative order used to facilitate the execution of the 
customer/client order.  
The fulfillmentLinkType field is used to indicate if the firm side details are required. Appendix C contains 
detailed descriptions of representative order scenarios and illustrates when marking of the representative 
order, linkage between the represented order and the representative order, and Order Fulfillment linkage 
is required.

4.12.3. Order Fulfillment Amendment Event 
This CAT event is used to report the amendment of a previously reported fulfillment that occurs on the 
same day or on a subsequent day. An Order Fulfillment Amendment event is required to be reported to 
CAT if the fill to the customer/client was changed after the final fulfillment had been provided to the 
customer/client. This Reportable Event must capture the entire state of the fulfillment after it has been 
amended, even though some of the data elements may remain unchanged. However, S ide Details are 
only required to be restated if changed. When the fulfillmentLinkType value ‘YS’ is used, Side Details 
must be restated using an MEOFS event if changed.  
Order Fulfillment Amendments are not required in scenarios where: 
• Executions against an order are tracked throughout the day but a single average price fill is 
provided to the customer/client after the order is completed or at the end of the day. Some 
systems may provide intraday transparency to the progress of executing an order as informal 
information that is not considered by the firm to be ‘final’ fulfillments, and these should not be 
reported to CAT as fulfillments and fulfillment amendments. Refer to CAT FAQ B64 for additional 
information. 
• An Industry Member makes a correction via a debit/credit to the customer’s/client’s account 
instead of modifying the executed shares given back to the customer/client.  
• Changes do not impact CAT reportable attributes of the fulfillment.

4.13.2. Amended Allocation Event 
An Amended Allocation event is used to report to CAT when an allocation is updated such that a CAT 
reportable attribute is changed after the shares/contracts were originally booked in a customer account, 
and must always reflect the current state of the allocation. This Reportable Event must capture the entire 
state of the allocation after it has been amended, even though some of the data elements may remain 
unchanged.  
Changes to CAT reportable attributes of an allocation after the original booking of shares/contracts are 
required to be reported to CAT as either an Allocation Amendment event or the cancellation of a Post -
Trade Allocation event followed by a new Post-Trade Allocation event regardless if they occur pre-
settlement or post-settlement. 
Since changes to an allocation may occur any time after the original booking, the Amended Allocation 
event is due at 8AM on the next CAT Trading Day after the change was booked, even if it is on a different 
day than the original Allocation event. Refer to CAT FAQ U14 for additional information. 
Amended Allocation events must not be reported to CAT in scenarios where:  
• An Industry Member makes a correction via a debit/credit to the customer's/client’s account 
instead of modifying the allocation given to the customer/client.  
• Changes do not impact CAT reportable attributes of the allocation.  
Any changes to the FDID that the shares/contracts were originally booked to may be reported as either 
an Amended Allocation event or the cancellation of a Post-Trade Allocation event followed by a new Post-
Trade Allocation event regardless if they occur pre-settlement or post-settlement. 
Amended Allocation events must not be used to correct ingestion errors on a previously submitted 
MEPA/MEAA event.

4.14. Order Effective Event 
The Order Effective event is used to indicate that an order, or an underlying condition of an order, has 
become effective. This event is applicable to orders such as conditional (Refer to FAQ D26), Stop, Stop 
Limit, Trailing Stop, Trailing Stop Limit, Stop on Quote, and Stop Limit on Quote orders. This event is 
NOT applicable to Stop Stock transactions. The Order Effective event must be reported by the party that 
was holding the order at the time the order or condition became effective.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  155 
If the triggering event causing the order to become effective was a specific price, such as a stop price, the 
triggerPrice field must be populated in scenarios where the trigger price was not explicitly captured in the 
handlingInstructions field on the related new order (e.g., Stop Formula, Trailing Stop). In scenarios where 
the stop price was captured in prior CAT events associated with the order (e.g., as a N ame/Value pair in 
handlingInstructions on MENO and/or MEOA events), then the information may be optionally restated in 
the triggerPrice field on the Order Effective event; however, it is not required to be reported again. 
If a new order ID is generated when the order becomes effective, which replaces the prior order ID, the 
orderID field must capture the new order ID, and the priorOrderID field must reflect the order ID that is 
being replaced. If the orderID remains the same when the order becomes effective, the priorOrderID and 
priorOrderKeyDate must remain blank.

5.1. Simple Option Events 
5.1.1. New Option Order Event 
An Industry Member must report a New Option Order event to CAT when an order is received or 
originated. This includes: 
• New customer orders  
• Combined orders 
• Proprietary orders 
• Order(s) received from a non-reporting foreign broker-dealer or affiliate. 
An order received from another CAT Reporter (US broker-dealer or an exchange) must be reported as an 
Option Order Accepted event.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  162 
Combined Orders 
Industry Members are required to populate a representativeInd value of “O” in scenarios where the 
Industry Member, subject to applicable SRO rules, combines individual, simple option orders from 
customers before routing to an exchange as a single, simple order for execution. Explicit linkage is 
required between the combined order and the original customer orders through the aggregatedOrders  
field. 
Industry Members are required to populate a representativeInd value of “OS” when the number of 
combined orders included in the aggregatedOrders field causes the New Option Order event to exceed 
the maximum allowed message length, or when the orders being represented are not captured in the 
New Option Order event.

5.1.2. Option Order Supplement Event  
The Option Order Supplement event is a supplement to the New Option Order event. One New Option 
Order event can have multiple Option Order Supplement events. Multiple Option Order Supplement 
events are considered additions, not replacements or modifications.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  165 
This event accommodates reporting in the following scenarios:  
Aggregated Orders 
The Option Order Supplement can be used in scenarios when the New Option Order event exceeds the 
maximum length allowed, or when the orders being combined are not captured in the New Option Order 
event. 
The aggregatedOrders field in the Option Order Supplement event must contain the additional 
Aggregated Orders that were not captured in the original New Option Order event, or another Supplement 
event for the same order. 
      
Version 4.1.0 r4  166 
FDID 
This event accommodates reporting in scenarios when an Industry Member receives an order for a new 
account and the new account number, on which the FDID is based, is not yet available for creation and 
reporting of the CAT new order event. If an FDID has not yet been created when an order has been 
received, the Industry Member must populate the firmDesignatedID field in its New Option Order event 
with a value of ‘PENDING’.  
Once the FDID becomes available, the Industry Member must report the actual FDID in the 
firmDesignatedID field in an Option Order Supplement event. Any Option Order Supplement event with 
an FDID populated will not be considered late for CAT reporting purposes if it is received by T+3 @ 8:00 
AM ET.

5.1.3. Option Order Route Event 
An Industry Member must report to CAT an Option Order Route Event when:  
• Routing to another Industry Member 
• Routing to exchanges 
• Routing between two IMIDs (e.g., two different FINRA MPIDs) attributed to the same legal entity 
(i.e., the same CRD) 
In order for CAT to maintain order lifecycle linkage, the orderID populated in the Option Order Route 
event must reference the most recent internal ID of the order. For example, if an order was modified 
before routing out, the Route Event must use the ID assigned on the order modification.  
Internal routes to another desk or department within an Industry Member are not reported using the 
Option Order Route event; instead an Option Order Internal Route Accepted event is used. See the 
Option Order Internal Route Accepted section for more details. 
Handling Instructions on the Option Order Route 
The handling instructions included in this event must represent the handling instructions sent by the 
routing firm to the receiving destination. If the handling instructions do not change when the order is 
routed externally from the handling instructions received by the Industry Member and reported on the 
Option Order Accepted or New Option Order associated with the order, Industry Members may use the 
handlingInstructions value ‘RAR’ (Routed as Received) instead of repeating each individual handling 
instruction.

5.1.3.1. Option Route Modified Event 
Industry Members must report an Option Route Modified event to CAT when the Material Terms of a 
route have been changed (e.g., price, quantity), or when an option route is cancel/replaced.  
All attributes and Material Terms of the route listed on this event must be restated with the modification(s) 
reflected. The side field is required to be reported, but side adjustments are only allowed for same- side 
changes, including changes between Short Sale and Sell Long. Option Route Modified events must not 
be used to reflect a change in senderIMID, destination, or destinationType. These changes must be 
reflected as an Option Route Cancelled event followed by a new Option Order Route event.  
The routedOrderID of the Option Order Route event being modified must be reflected in the Option Route 
Modified event. If the routedOrderID changed when the route was modified, the routedOrderID of the 
Option Order Route event being modified must be populated in the priorRoutedOrderID  field. If the 
routedOrderID did not change when the route was modified, the routedOrderID of the Order Route event 
must be populated in the routedOrderID field, and the dupROIDCond field must be populated as true. 
If a route modification is rejected by the destination venue, the Option Route Modified event must be 
reported with a routeRejectedFlag of true.

5.1.3.2. Option Route Cancelled Event 
Industry Members must report an Option Route Cancelled event to CAT when a route has been fully or 
partially cancelled. Partial cancellations of a route may be reported to CAT using an Option Route 
Cancelled event or an Option Route Modified event. However, when routing between Industry Members, 
both parties must communicate and use the same method to report to CAT. If one party reports to CAT 
using the cancellation method and the other party reports to CAT using a modification method, this will 
result in unlinked records that must be resolved. 
The routedOrderID of the Option Order Route event being cancelled must be reflected in the Option 
Route Cancelled event. If a route cancellation is rejected by the destination venue, the Option Route  
Cancelled event must be reported with a routeRejectedFlag of true.

5.1.5. Option Order Internal Route Accepted 
An Option Order Internal Route Accepted event must be reported when an order is passed internally to a 
different department or desk within a CATReporterIMID. Routes between different IMIDs attributed to the 
same Industry Member must be reported as Option Order Route and Option Order Accepted events.  
An Option Order Internal Route Accepted event is required to be reported from the perspective of the 
recipient desk, and indicates that an order was received by an internal destination.  In Phase 2d, Industry 
Members may choose to assign a new Order Key to an Option Order Internal Route Accepted event. If a 
new orderID is assigned, the parentOrderID must be populated with the orderID of the event that was 
internally routed, and the parentOrderKeyDate must be populated.  
Industry Members may generate child orders using the Child Option Order event prior to routing internally 
to another desk. This approach is acceptable for CAT reporting and will not result in unlinked events.  
5.1.5.1. Option Order Internal Route Accepted Event 
Option Order Internal Route Accepted event is used to report an order sent internally to another desk.

5.1.6. Child Option Order Event 
The Child Option Order is used to represent instances when an order is sliced within the desk or 
department it is being worked, and is assigned a new order identifier. While all CAT reportable activity 
must be reported to CAT in applicable phases, Child Option Order events are not required to be utilized 
for CAT reporting. These event types are provided for the convenience of Industry Members to help 
model these types of order handling scenarios. 
Child Option Order events are defined to include only the key data elements that may be changed when 
the event is created including fields to link to the parent order. The following rules apply with respect to 
Child Option Orders:  
• Child Option Order events can only be used when an order is sliced and assigned new order IDs 
within the same desk. An Option Order Internal Route Accepted event must be reported when 
routed to another desk.  
• A child order may be generated off of another child order without limitation.  
• Child Option Orders must belong to the same FDID as the parent order. 
• Child Option Orders must not be used to represent a multi-leg option order being “legged out”. 
However, the Child Order event may be used in scenarios where an order is “legged out” and     
Version 4.1.0 r4  196 
subsequently entered into another OMS/EMS or Algo within the same desk or department where 
a new orderID is assigned to each leg upon entry.

Child Option Order Modified event must not be used when modifying an Option Order Internal Route 
Accepted event.  
Industry Members may assign a new Order Key to Child Option Order Modified events. If a unique 
orderID is assigned, the priorOrderID must be populated with the orderID of the Child Option Order event 
that is being modified, and the priorOrderKeyDate must be populated.

5.1.6.3. Child Option Order Cancelled Event 
If a child option order is cancelled, a Child Option Order Cancelled event must be reported to CAT by the 
Industry Member.  
A partial cancellation can be reported either with a Child Option Order Modified event or Child Option 
Order Cancelled event with leavesQty, depending on how it is handled by the Industry Member. If a 
cancel message was used, the Industry Member must report a Child Option Order Cancelled event to 
CAT. If a modify or cancel/replace message was used, a Child Option Order Modified event must be 
reported to CAT. This keeps the reported event in line with the action taken by the Industry Member.

5.1.7. Option Order Modified (Cancel/Replace) Event 
Industry Members must report an Option Order Modified event to CAT when the Material Terms of an 
order have been changed (e.g., price, quantity), or when an order is cancel/replaced. All attributes and 
Material Terms of the modified order must be restated with the modification(s) reflected. If the order is a 
combined order, the aggregatedOrders field must be restated every time the order is modified or 
cancel/replaced. Changes to the orders being combined in the aggregatedOrders field are considered a 
modification to the order. The side field is required to be reported, but side adjustments are only allowed 
for same-side changes, including changes between Short Sale and Sell Long. 
If a modification results in the generation of new order with a new Order Key which replaces the prior 
order, the orderID field must capture the identifier for the new order, and the prior order fields must reflect 
the order that is being replaced. If the order has been modified more than once with a new orderID 
assigned with each modification, the priorOrderID must refer to orderID of the immediately preceding 
modification which will not be the original Order ID. If the orderID remains the same during the 
modification, the priorOrderID must remain blank.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  202 
All attributes and Material Terms of the modified order listed on this event must be reported when 
applicable, including the fields that remain unchanged. 
Industry Members are not required to report the modification request to CAT if the order is terminal (e.g., 
it has already been fully executed or cancelled) in Phase 2d. However, this activity may be required in 
future phases of CAT. If a modification request was received that was too late to modify, and the order 
was not terminal (e.g., the order was “in-flight” and there was no confirmation time), the request must be 
reported as an Option Order Modification Request event.

5.1.8. Option Order Adjusted Event 
The Option Order Adjusted event may be used instead of an Option Order Modified event to report 
changes to the price or quantity of an order. However, the Option Order Adjust events must not be used 
when changes to the price or quantity is initiated by a routing Industry Member.  
The following rules apply: 
• If the price changes, then price must be reported to represent current state of the order relative to 
price. The quantity fields are not required.  
• If any of the quantity fields change, then all quantity fields (i.e., quantity, minQty, leavesQty) must 
be reported to represent the current state of the order relative to quantity. The price field is not 
required.  
Any modification that cannot be fully represented in this Reportable Event must be reported via the 
Option Order Modified event. This includes modifications received from another Industry Member where a 
routedOrderID is required, and modifications to the orderType. 
Industry Members may assign a new Order Key to Option Order Adjusted events. If a unique orderID is 
assigned, the priorOrderID must be populated with the orderID of the event that is being adjusted, and the 
priorOrderKeyDate must be populated. If the order has been adjusted several times, the priorOrderID 
must refer to order ID of the order that is being replaced. If the order ID remains the same during the 
adjustment, the priorOrderID must remain blank.

5.1.9. Option Order Cancelled Event 
The Option Order Cancelled event is reported when an order is fully or partially cancelled. Partial 
cancellations of an order may be reported to CAT using an Option Order Cancelled event or an Option 
Order Modified event. However, when routing between Industry Members, both parties must 
communicate and use the same method to report to CAT. If one party reports to CAT using the 
cancellation method and the other party reports to CAT using a modification method, this will result in 
unlinked records that must be resolved. 
Implicit order cancellations, such as cancellations due to expiration of Time in Force, are not required to 
be reported to CAT.  
Option Order Cancelled events are required to be reported by the entity that initiated the cancellation. 
When an Order is routed from Firm A to Firm B, the following rules apply: 
• If Firm A or its customer/client initiates the cancel, then Firm A and Firm B must report the Option 
Order Cancelled. 
• If Firm B initiates the cancel, then Firm B must report the Option Order Cancelled. 
Industry Members are not required to report the cancel request to CAT if the order is terminal (e.g., it has 
already been fully executed or cancelled) in Phase 2d. However, this activity may be required in future 
phases of CAT. If a cancellation request was received that was too late to cancel, and the order was not     
Version 4.1.0 r4  212 
terminal (e.g., the order was “in-flight” and there is no confirmation time), the request must be reported as 
an Option Order Cancel Request event.

5.1.10. Option Quotes 
Option Quote events are used to report electronic RFQ responses communicated in standard electronic 
format (e.g., FIX) that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT under the definition 
of an “order” under Rule 613(j)(8), provided by, or received in, a CAT Reporter’s order/quote handling or 
execution system or Third Party RFQ Platform in CAT reportable option securities.  
The following guidance applies to electronic quotes in Listed Options Securities and electronic RFQ 
responses communicated in standard electronic format (e.g., FIX) that are not immediately actionable that 
need to be reported to CAT, sent to a CAT Reporter’s or Third Party Vendor RFQ platform: 
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
sent to an RFQ platform or a Third Party Vendor platform operated by an Industry Member must 
be reported using the New Option Quote and Option Routed Quote events.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  215 
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
received by an Industry Member CAT Reporter operating an RFQ system using the Option Quote 
Received event.  
• Electronic RFQ responses that meet the definition of bid or offer under the CAT NMS Plan sent 
by a broker-dealer to an RFQ Platform not operated by a CAT Reporter must be reported using 
the New Option Quote event. 
Option Quote events are exclusively associated with RFQ responses that are communicated in standard 
electronic format directly to an Industry Member’s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not 
“immediately actionable” (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be executed/routed), which are 
not required to be reported to CAT until August 1, 2026, to the extent such responses are considered 
“orders” reportable pursuant to Rule 613(j)(8). See Section 3.4: Responses to RFQs and Solicitation for 
more information. 
 
 
5.1.10.1. New Option Quote Event 
The New Option Quote Event is used to report the following: 
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
originated in listed option securities ultimately sent to RFQ system operated by an Industry 
Member 
• Electronic RFQ responses that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, 
originated in listed option securities ultimately sent to a Third Party RFQ Platform not operated 
by a CAT Reporter.  
• Any other electronic quotes which are provided by or received in a CAT Reporter’s order/quote 
handling or execution systems in CAT reportable securities and are provided by an Industry 
Member to other market participants off a national securities exchange, as described in CAT 
FAQ B45.  
For two-sided quote events, the bidPrice, bidQty, askPrice and askQty fields must be populated. For one-
sided quote events, the price and quantity of the applicable side must be populated. If the 
bidRelativePrice / askRelativePrice field is populated, the bidPrice and askPrice fields are not required to 
be populated. 
If the field onlyOneQuoteFlag is populated as ‘true’, any New Option Quote event offered by the same 
CATReporterIMID to the same destination in the same symbol will be considered cancelled and replaced 
by CAT. Modifications reflected using the onlyOneQuoteFlag method may maintain the same quote ID.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  216 
However, if a quote is cancelled and a new quote is reported to CAT, the New Option Quote Event must 
not maintain the same quote ID as the quote that was cancelled. 
This event is exclusively associated with RFQ responses that are communicated in standard electronic 
format directly to an Industry Member’s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not “immediately 
actionable” (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be executed/routed), which are not required 
to be reported to CAT until August 1, 2026, to the extent such responses are considered “orders” 
reportable pursuant to Rule 613(j)(8). See Section 3.4: Responses to RFQs and Solicitation for more 
information.

5.1.10.3. Option Quote Received/Replace Event 
The Option Quote Received event is used to report New Option Quotes or electronic RFQ responses that 
are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT under the definition of an “order” under 
Rule 613(j)(8), in Listed Option securities received by an Industry Member operating an RFQ platform or a 
quotation venue not operated by a CAT Reporter, and also to update and replace an existing RFQ 
response on an RFQ platform. 
For two-sided quote events, the bidPrice, bidQty, askPrice and askQty fields must be populated. For one-
sided quote events, the price and quantity of the applicable side must be populated.  If the 
bidRelativePrice / askRelativePrice field is populated, the bidPrice and askPrice fields are not required to 
be populated. 
If the field onlyOneQuoteFlag is populated as ‘true’, any Option Quote Received event offered by the 
same CATReporterIMID from the same senderIMID in the same symbol will be considered cancelled and 
replaced by CAT. Modifications reflected using the onlyOneQuoteFlag method may maintain the same 
quote ID.  However, if a quote is cancelled and a new quote is reported to CAT, the Option Quote 
Received Event must not maintain the same quote ID as the quote that was cancelled.  Modifications to a 
quote when the onlyOneQuoteFlag is populated as ‘true’ may alternatively be captured using the Quote 
Modified event. 
This event is exclusively associated with RFQ responses that are communicated in standard electronic 
format directly to an Industry Member’s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not “immediately 
actionable” (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be executed/routed), which are not required 
to be reported to CAT until August 1, 2026, to the extent such responses are considered “orders” 
reportable pursuant to Rule 613(j)(8). See Section 3.4: Responses to RFQs and Solicitation for more 
information.

5.1.12.3. Option Order Fulfillment Amendment Event  
This CAT event is used to report the amendment of a previously reported fulfillment that occurs on the 
same day or on a subsequent day. An Option Order Fulfillment Amendment event is required to be 
reported to CAT if the fill to the customer/client was changed after the final fulfillment had been provided 
to the customer/client. This Reportable Event must capture the entire state of the fulfillment after it has 
been amended, even though some of the data elements may remain unchanged.  
Option Order Fulfillment Amendments are not required in scenarios where: 
• Executions against an order are tracked throughout the day but a single average price fill is 
provided to the customer/client after the order is completed or at the end of the day. Some 
systems may provide intraday transparency to the progress of executing an order as informal 
information that is not considered by the firm to be ‘final’ fulfillments, and these should not be 
reported to CAT as fulfillments and fulfillment amendments. Refer to CAT FAQ B64 for additional 
information. 
• An Industry Member makes a correction via a debit/credit to the customer's /client’s account 
instead of modifying the executed contracts given back to the customer/client.  
• Changes do not impact CAT reportable attributes of the fulfillment. 
• When an Industry Member fulfils an order and receives a trade break from the exchange, it is 
possible that the Industry Member may choose to take the delta (e.g., using an error account) 
without amending the manner by which the order was fulfilled.

5.1.13.2. Option Amended Allocation Event 
An Option Amended Allocation event is used to report to CAT when an allocation is updated such that a 
CAT reportable attribute is changed after the shares/contracts were originally booked in a customer 
account, and must always reflect the current state of the allocation. This Reportable Event must capture 
the entire state of the allocation after it has been amended, even though some of the data elements may 
remain unchanged.  
Changes to CAT reportable attributes of an allocation after the original booking of shares/contracts are 
required to be reported to CAT as either an Option Amended Allocation event or the cancellation of an 
Option Post-Trade Allocation event followed by a new Option Post-Trade Allocation event regardless if 
they occur pre-settlement or post-settlement. 
Since changes to an allocation may occur any time after the original booking, the Amended Allocation 
event is due at 8AM on the next CAT Trading Day after the change was booked, even if it is on a different 
day than the original Allocation event. Refer to CAT FAQ U14 for additional information.  
Option Amended Allocation events must not be reported to CAT in scenarios where: 
• An Industry Member makes a correction via a debit/credit to the customer's account instead of 
modifying the allocation given to the customer.  
• Changes do not impact CAT reportable attributes of the allocation.  
Any changes to the FDID the shares/contracts were originally booked in a customer  account may be 
reported as either an Amended Allocation event or the cancellation of a Post-Trade Allocation event 
followed by a new Post-Trade Allocation event regardless if they occur pre-settlement or post-settlement. 
Option Amended Allocation events must not be used to correct ingestion errors on a previously submitted 
MOPA/MOAA event.

5.1.14. Option Order Effective Event 
The Option Order Effective event is used to indicate that an order, or an underlying condition of an order, 
has become effective. This event is applicable to orders such as conditional (Refer to FAQ D26 ), Stop, 
Stop Limit, Trailing Stop, Trailing Stop Limit, Stop on Quote, and Stop Limit on Quote orders. This event     
Version 4.1.0 r4  239 
is NOT applicable to Stop Stock transactions. The Option Order Effective event must be reported by the 
party that was holding the order at the time the order or condition became effective.  
If the triggering event causing the order to become effective was a specific price, such as a stop price, the 
triggerPrice field must be populated in scenarios where the trigger price was not explicitly captured in the 
handlingInstructions field on the related new order (e.g., Stop Formula, Trailing Stop). In scenarios where 
the stop price was captured in prior CAT events associated with the order (e.g., as a N ame/Value pair in 
handlingInstructions on MONO and/or MOOA events), then the information may be optionally restated in 
the triggerPrice field on the Option Order Effective event; however, it is not required to be reported again. 
If a new order ID is generated when the order becomes effective, which replaces the prior order ID, the 
orderID field must capture the new order ID, and the priorOrderID field must reflect the order ID that is 
being replaced. If the orderID remains the same when the order becomes effective, the priorOrderID and 
priorOrderKeyDate must remain blank.

5.2. Multi-Leg/Complex Option Order Events 
The following multi-leg/complex orders must be reported to CAT: 
• A multi-leg order that meets the definition of an exchange-defined complex order and is routed to 
an options exchange as a complex order. The definition of complex order in this context is not 
dependent on any NMS or options linkage plan trade through exemption provision embedded 
within an exchange’s definition of a complex order. 
• A multi-leg order involving at least one option leg received by a broker-dealer as a single 
instruction where all legs of the order are linked and such linkage affects the price of any 
individual leg of the order. A typical example of this type of order would be a Buy/Write . 
The following are examples of orders that would not be reported to CAT as a multi-leg order: 
• Baskets  
• Complex/multi-leg orders that do not involve an option 
Multi-Leg Option Order events include both strategy level details, and leg level details that are 
represented as a multi-dimensional array. The number of CAT reportable legs must be identified in the 
numberOfLegs field. If a strategy involves legs that are not CAT reportable, such as futures or fixed 
income, the relevant handlingInstructions value must be populated.  
There is no limit to the number of legDetails that may be included in a multi-leg order event, however, the 
number of legs able to be represented in each record is constrained by record size limits. If a Multi -Leg 
Order event has more legs than can be represented in an order event, additional legs must be 
represented in a Multi-Leg Order Supplement event.  
There are no multi-leg trade, fulfillment, or allocation events. Trades, fulfillments, and allocations of a 
multi-leg order occur at the leg level, and must be reported to CAT as equity or simple option Trade, 
Order Fulfillment, or Allocation events.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  242 
Route of a Multi-Leg Option Order as Individual Legs 
In scenarios where the Multi-Leg order is “legged-out” and routed as individual legs, the route of each leg 
must be reported as a simple Order Route or Option Order Route event with the multiLegInd populated. 
This guidance applies in scenarios where: 
• A Multi-Leg order is received/originated and routed directly to the destination venue as a simple 
Order Route or Option Order Route event. In this scenario, the multiLegInd must be populated as 
‘true’ on each Order Route or Option Order Route event.  
• A Multi-Leg order is received/originated and routed internally as individual legs before being 
routed to the destination venue by the receiving desk or department. 15 In this scenario, the 
multiLegInd must be populated as ‘true’ on each Order Internal Route Accepted or Option Order 
Internal Route Accepted event. The multiLegInd must be ‘false’ on subsequent Order Route or 
Option Order Route events. 
• A Multi-Leg order is received/originated and is entered into a separate OMS/EMS or Algo as 
individual legs where a new orderID is generated, and the Industry Member chooses to report 
simple Child Order or Child Option Order events. While Child Order events must not be used to 
represent the order being “legged out”, in this case a new orderID is assigned to each individual 
leg when entered into the OMS/EMS or Algo. In this scenario, the multiLegInd must be populated 
as ‘true’ on each Child Order or Child Option Order event. The multiLegInd must be ‘false’ on 
subsequent Order Route or Option Order Route events. 
5.2.1. Multi-Leg New Order Event 
Multi-Leg New Order events are used to report the receipt or origination of a Multi -Leg order event.  
Combined Orders 
Industry Members are required to populate a representativeInd value of “OML” in scenarios where the 
Industry Member, subject to applicable SRO rules, combines individual Multi-Leg Option orders from 
customers/clients with the same strategy before routing to an exchange as a single Multi-Leg order for 
execution. Explicit linkage is required between the combined Multi-Leg order and the original 
customer/client orders through the aggregatedOrders field. 
 
 
15 Refer to CAT FAQ E1 for additional information.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  243 
Industry Members are required to populate a representativeInd value of “OMS” when the number of 
combined orders included in the aggregatedOrders field causes the Multi-Leg New Order event to exceed 
the maximum allowed message length, or when the orders being represented are not captured in the 
Multi-Leg New Order Event. 
Multi-Leg orders may only be combined if they contain the same strategy. Multi -Leg orders with different 
strategies that are handled simultaneously are considered a basket for CAT reporting purposes and must 
not be represented as one combined Multi-Leg New Order event. 
Fills of a Multi-Leg order occur at the leg level and must be reported to CAT as simple Order Fulfillment or 
Options Order Fulfillment events with a fulfillmentLinkType value of “OML” to indicate that the orderID 
referenced in the firmDetails is a Multi-Leg New Order event.  
Individual Legs Represented as FIX Messages 
In scenarios where a multi-leg order is received as individual FIX messages for each leg with instructions 
to treat as a complex order, or in scenarios where a multi-leg order is received manually and is followed 
by individual FIX messages for each leg, the receipt of the individual FIX messages are not required to be 
reported to CAT. The industry Member is only required to report the receipt of the Multi -Leg order.  
If the Industry Member is unable to suppress the reporting of these FIX messages, they must be reported 
as simple New Order or Order Accepted events with a handlingInstructions value of ‘CMPX’. Events with 
a handlingInstructions value of ‘CMPX’ will not be linked to the Multi-Leg New Order event.

Cancelled event or a Multi-Leg Route Modified event. However, when routing between Industry Members, 
both parties must communicate and use the same method to report to CAT. If one party reports to CAT 
using the cancellation method and the other party reports to CAT using a modification method, this will 
result in unlinked records that must be resolved. 
The routedOrderID of the Multi-Leg Order Route event being cancelled must be reflected in the Multi-Leg

5.2.5. Multi-Leg Child Order Event 
A Multi-Leg Child Order event must be reported to CAT when a Multi-Leg order is sliced within the desk or 
department it is being worked, and is assigned a new order identifier. While all CAT reportable activity 
must be reported to CAT in applicable phases, Multi-Leg Child Order events are not required to be 
utilized for CAT reporting. These event types are provided for the convenience of Industry Members to 
help model these types of order handling scenarios. 
The following rules apply with respect to Child Option Orders:  
• Multi-Leg Child Order events can only be used when an order is sliced and assigned new or der 
IDs within the same desk. A Multi-Leg Order Internal Route Accepted event must be reported 
when routed to another desk.  
• A child order may be generated off of another child order without limitation.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  272 
• Multi-Leg Child Orders must belong to the same FDID as the parent order. 
• Multi-Leg Child Order events must not be used to represent a multi-leg option order being 
“legged out”. Multi-Leg Child Order events must only be used to represent a multi-leg option order 
being sliced while maintaining the same strategy

5.2.5.3. Multi-Leg Child Order Cancelled Event 
If a multi-leg child order is cancelled, a Multi-Leg Child Order Cancelled event must be reported to CAT by 
the Industry Member.  
A partial cancellation can be reported either with a Multi-Leg Child Order Modified event or Multi-Leg 
Child Order Cancelled event with leavesQty, depending on how it is handled by the Industry Member. If a 
cancel message was used, the Industry Member must report a Multi-Leg Child Order Cancelled event to 
CAT. If a modify or cancel/replace message was used, a Multi-Leg Child Order Modified event must be 
reported to CAT. This keeps the reported event in line with the action taken by the Industry Member.

5.2.6. Multi-Leg Order Modified Event 
Industry Members must report a Multi-Leg Order Modified event to CAT when the Material Terms of a 
Multi-Leg order have been changed (e.g., price, quantity) or when a Multi-Leg order is cancel/replaced. 
Changes to the strategy of the order, such as changes to the ratio, changes to the product or the side of 
the product contained within the legs (e.g., buy to sell), or changes to the number of legs, are not 
considered a modification to the order. This activity must be reported to CAT as a new multi -leg order 
event.  
All attributes and Material Terms of the modified order listed on this event must be restated with the 
modification(s) reflected. If the order is a combined order, the aggregatedOrders field must be restated 
every time the order is modified or cancel/replaced. Changes to the orders being combined in the 
aggregatedOrders field are considered a modification to the order.  
Industry Members may assign a new Order Key to all Multi-Leg Order Modified events. If a unique 
orderID is assigned, the priorOrderID must be populated with the orderID of the order that is being 
modified, and the priorOrderKeyDate must be populated. If the order has been modified more than once, 
the priorOrderID must refer to orderID of the immediately preceding modification which will not be the 
original Order ID.  
Industry Members are not required to report the modification request to CAT if the order is terminal (e.g., 
it has already been fully executed or cancelled) in Phase 2d. However, this activity may be required in 
future phases of CAT. If a modification request was received that was too late to modify, and the order 
was not terminal (e.g., the order was “in-flight” and there was no confirmation time), the request must be 
reported as a Multi-Leg Order Modification Request event.

5.2.7. Multi-Leg Order Cancelled Event 
The Multi-Leg Order Cancelled event is reported when a Multi-Leg order is fully or partially cancelled. 
However, when routing between Industry Members, both parties must communicate and use the same 
method to report to CAT. If one party reports to CAT using the cancellation method and the other party 
reports to CAT using a modification method, this will result in unlinked records that must be resolved. 
Changes to the strategy of the order, such as changes to the ratio, a reduction of the legRatioQuantity , or 
a reduction in the number of legs, are not considered a partial cancellation.  
Industry Members are not required to report the cancel request to CAT if the order is terminal (e.g., it has 
already been fully executed or cancelled) in Phase 2d. However, this activity may be required in future 
phases of CAT. If a cancellation request was received that was too late to cancel, and the order was not 
terminal (e.g., the order was “in-flight” and there is no confirmation time), the request must be reported as 
a Multi-Leg Order Cancel Request event.

5.2.8. Multi-Leg Quotes 
Multi-Leg Quote events are used to report electronic quotes or electronic RFQ responses that are not 
immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT under the definition of an “order” under Rule 
613(j)(8), of multi-leg quotes which are provided by or received in an Industry Member’s RFQ platform or 
Third Party RFQ Platform in CAT reportable Eligible Securities.  
The following guidance applies to quotes of multi-leg quotes on Eligible Securities sent to a CAT 
Reporter’s or a Third Party Vendor RFQ platform: 
• Multi-Leg Quotes or electronic RFQ responses of multi-leg quotes in CAT reportable Eligible 
Securities that are not immediately actionable that need to be reported to CAT, sent to an RFQ 
platform operated by an Industry Member or a Third Party Vendor must be reported using the 
Multi-Leg New Quote and Multi-Leg Routed Quote events. 
• Multi-Leg Quotes or electronic RFQ responses of multi-leg quotes in CAT reportable Eligible 
Securities received by an Industry Member CAT Reporter operating an RFQ system using the 
Multi-Leg Quote Received event.  
• Multi-Leg Quotes in CAT reportable Eligible Securities that meet the definition of bid or offer 
under the CAT NMS Plan sent by a broker-dealer to a quotation venue not operated by a CAT 
Reporter must be reported using the Multi-Leg New Quote event. 
 
5.2.8.1. Multi-Leg New Quote Events 
The Multi-Leg New Quote Event is used to report the following: 
• Multi-Leg Quotes or electronic RFQ responses of multi-leg quotes that are not immediately 
actionable that need to be reported to CAT, originated in CAT reportable Eligible Securities 
ultimately sent to RFQ system operated by an Industry Member     
Version 4.1.0 r4  290 
• Multi-Leg Quotes or electronic RFQ responses of multi-leg quotes that are not immediately 
actionable that need to be reported to CAT, originated in CAT reportable Eligible Securities 
ultimately sent to a Third Party RFQ Platform not operated by a CAT Reporter.  
• Any other electronic quotes which are provided by or received in a CAT Reporter’s order/quote 
handling or execution systems in CAT reportable securities and are provided by an Industry 
Member to other market participants off a national securities exchange, as described in CAT 
FAQ B45.  
For two-sided quote events, the bidPrice, bidQty, askPrice and askQty fields must be populated. For one-
sided quote events, the price and quantity of the applicable side must be populated.  
If the field onlyOneQuoteFlag is populated as ‘true’, any Multi-Leg New Quote event offered by the same 
CATReporterIMID to the same destination in the same symbol will be considered cancelled and replaced 
by CAT. Modifications reflected using the onlyOneQuoteFlag method may maintain the same quote ID.  
However, if a quote is cancelled and a new quote is reported to CAT, the Multi-Leg New Quote Event 
must not maintain the same quote ID as the quote that was cancelled. 
Multi-Leg Quote events are exclusively associated with RFQ responses that are communicated in 
standard electronic format directly to an Industry Member’s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are 
not “immediately actionable” (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be executed/routed), which 
are not required to be reported to CAT until August 1, 2026, to the extent such responses are considered 
“orders” reportable pursuant to Rule 613(j)(8). See Section 3.4: Responses to RFQs and Solicitation for 
more information.

5.2.8.3. Multi-Leg Quote Supplement Event 
The Multi-Leg Quote Supplement event may be used to supplement any Multi-Leg Quote event. Multi-Leg 
Quote Supplement events are considered as additions to a Multi-Leg Quote event, not replacements or 
modifications. There is no limit to the number of Multi-Leg Quote Supplement events that may 
supplement a single Multi-Leg Quote event. When supplementing a Multi-Leg Routed Quote event, the 
Industry Member must identify the specific Multi-Leg Routed Quote event being supplemented by 
populating the Route Linkage Key fields. 
The Multi-Leg Quote Supplement event is used in the following scenarios.  
• A Multi-Leg Quote event has more legs than can be represented in an quote event, additional 
legs must be represented in a Multi-Leg Quote Supplement event.  
• An Industry Member receives an order for a new account and the new account number, on which 
the FDID is based, is not yet available for creation and reporting of the CAT multi-leg new quote 
event. If an FDID has not yet been created when a multi-leg quote has been received, the 
Industry Member must populate the firmDesignatedID field in its Multi-Leg New Quote event with 
a value of ‘PENDING’. Once the FDID becomes available, the Industry Member must report the 
actual FDID in the firmDesignatedID field in an Multi-Leg Quote Supplement. Any Multi-Leg 
Quote Supplement event with an FDID populated will not be considered late for CAT reporting 
purposes if it is received by T+3 @ 8:00 AM ET. 
• A Multi-Leg Routed Quote event is rejected by the venue to which it was routed, and the Industry 
Member chooses to report the quoteRejectedFlag in this separate Multi-Leg Quote Supplement 
event. If an Industry Member must update the quoteRejectedFlag on a Multi-Leg Routed Quote 
event from ‘false’ to ‘true’, this must be done through a correction to the original submission using 
‘COR’. 
This event is exclusively associated with RFQ responses that are communicated in standard 
electronic format directly to an Industry Member’s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not 
“immediately actionable” (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be executed/routed), which 
are not required to be reported to CAT until August 1, 2026, to the extent such responses are 
considered “orders” reportable pursuant to Rule 613(j)(8). See Section 3.4: Responses to RFQs and 
Solicitation for more information.

5.2.9. Multi-Leg Order Supplement Event 
The Multi-Leg Order Supplement event may be used to supplement any Multi-Leg Order event. Multi-Leg 
Order Supplement events are considered as additions to a Multi-Leg Order event, not replacements or 
modifications. There is no limit to the number of Multi-Leg Order Supplement events that may supplement 
a single Multi-Leg Order event. When supplementing a Multi-Leg Order Route event, the Industry 
Member must identify the specific Multi-Leg Order Route event being supplemented by populating the 
Route Linkage Key fields. 
The Multi-Leg Order Supplement event is used in the following scenarios.  
• A Multi-Leg Order event has more legs than can be represented in an order event, additional legs 
must be represented in a Multi-Leg Order Supplement event.  
• Aggregated Orders included in the aggregatedOrders field causes the Multi-Leg New Order event 
or Multi-Leg Order Modified event to exceed the maximum allowed message length, or when the 
orders being represented are not captured in the Multi-Leg New Order event or Multi-Leg Order 
Modified event. The aggregatedOrders field in the Multi-Leg Order Supplement event must 
contain the additional Aggregated Orders that were not captured in the original New Order event, 
or another Supplement event for the same order. 
• An Industry Member receives an order for a new account and the new account number, on which 
the FDID is based, is not yet available for creation and reporting of the CAT new order event. If 
an FDID has not yet been created when an order has been received, the Industry Member must 
populate the firmDesignatedID field in its Multi-Leg New Order event with a value of ‘PENDING’. 
Once the FDID becomes available, the Industry Member must report the actual FDID in the     
Version 4.1.0 r4  307 
firmDesignatedID field in an Multi-Leg Order Supplement. Any Multi-Leg Order Supplement event 
with an FDID populated will not be considered late for CAT reporting purposes if it is received by 
T+3 @ 8:00 AM ET. 
• A Multi-Leg Order Route event is rejected by the venue to which it was routed, and the Industry 
Member chooses to report the routeRejectedFlag in this separate Multi-Leg Order Supplement 
event. This event may not be used to supplement the routeRejectedFlag on a Multi-Leg Route 
Modified or Cancelled event, as CAT will not be able to determine that the record is not intended 
to supplement a Multi-Leg Order Route event. These supplement events will be accepted by CAT, 
but credit will not be provided to any exchange linkage errors on Multi-Leg Route Modified events, 
and Multi-Leg Route Cancelled events will not be considered supplemented. If an Industry 
Members must update the routeRejectedFlag on a Multi-Leg Route Modified or Cancelled event 
from ‘false’ to ‘true’, this must be done through a correction to the original submission using ‘COR’.

5.2.10. Multi-Leg Order Effective Event 
The Multi-Leg Order Effective Event may be submitted in the Production Environment beginning on 
December 5, 2022. 
The Multi-Leg Order Effective event is used to indicate that an order, or an underlying condition of an 
order, has become effective. This event is applicable to orders such as conditional (refer to FAQ D26 ), 
Stop, Stop Limit, Trailing Stop, Trailing Stop Limit, Stop on Quote, and Stop Limit on Quote orders. This 
event is NOT applicable to Stop Stock transactions. The Multi-Leg Order Effective event must be reported 
by the party that was holding the order at the time the order or condition became effective.  
If the triggering event causing the order to become effective was a specific price, such as a stop price, the 
triggerPrice field must be populated in scenarios where the trigger price was not explicitly captured in the 
handlingInstructions field on the related new order (e.g., Stop Formula, Trailing Stop). In scenarios where 
the stop price was captured in prior CAT events associated with the order (e.g., as a N ame/Value pair in 
handlingInstructions on MLNO and/or MLOA events), then the information may be optionally restated in 
the triggerPrice field on the Multi-Leg Order Effective event; however, it is not required to be reported 
again. 
If a new order ID is generated when the order becomes effective, which replaces the prior order ID, the 
orderID field must capture the new order ID, and the priorOrderID field must reflect the order ID that is 
being replaced. If the orderID remains the same when the order becomes effective, the priorOrderID and 
priorOrderKeyDate must remain blank.

This section contains information pertaining to CAT data and file formats, CAT submissions (including a 
general data flow overview), network and transport options, CAT access and reporting hours.  
6.1. File Submissions and Data Formats 
CAT submissions must include Data Files, which have a prescribed naming convention and are 
supported in JSON and CSV formats. Effective July 24, 2023, the Metadata File submission associated 
with the Data File will no longer be supported. If a Metadata file is submitted on or after July 24, 2023, it 
will be rejected at the File Acknowledgement stage of processing.  
6.1.1. File Submission Names 
• Data Files must be named using the following format: 
<CAT Submitter ID>_<CAT Reporter IMID>_<File Generation 
Date>_[<Group>_]<File Kind>_<File Number>[.File Instruction].<Format

6.1.2. Submission Formats 
CAT supports the submission of Data Files in JSON and CSV formats.  
6.1.2.1. General Submission Rules 
The following rules apply to the submission of Data Files in either CSV or JSON format: 
1. CAT submissions must only include Data Files, which are processed independently.  
2. Each line in a file must contain exactly one complete record. 
3. The total maximum length of a line is 8190 bytes.  
4. Non-printable characters and whitespace are bytes that are included in the character count when 
validating a record has NOT exceeded the maximum length. 
6.1.2.2. JSON Format Submission Rules 
The following rules apply to the submission of Data Files in JSON format only:     
Version 4.1.0 r4  316 
1. The CAT Processor supports standard JSON syntax for each record or syntax as specified in this 
document. 
2. Backslash ‘\’ is a reserved printable character in JSON and must be escaped in order to be used in 
strings by inserting a backslash prior to it within the string. For example: routedOrderID = 1234\ABCD 
must be reported to CAT as “routedOrderID”:”1234\\ABCD”. If a backslash is not escaped, it will be 
omitted from the string. For example, if “routedOrderID”:”1234\ABCD” is reported to CAT, it will be 
stored as routedOrderID = 1234ABCD. 
3. Data Files serve as top-level containers for each object. Each object is a normal JSON object, 
separated with a new-line (ASCII decimal 10, hex 0A).  
a. Data within the object must not include new-lines. 
b. Conditional and optional fields without a value must be omitted. 
c. Each line within a Data File must contain exactly one complete record. The following example is 
a CAT event in the required submission format. The record is delivered in a single line with a 
new-line character at the end: 
{"actionType":"RPR","errorROEID":12345678,"firmROEID":"20170801_firmROEO12345","ty
pe":"MENO","orderKeyDate":"20170801T143031.000000","orderID":"O12345","symbol":"XY
Z","eventTimestamp":"20170801T143031.123456","manualFlag":false,"deptType":"O","si
de":"B","price":10.01,"quantity":500,"orderType":"LMT","timeInForce":{"DAY":201708
01},"tradingSession":"REG","custDspIntrFlag":false,"firmDesignatedID":"PROP456","a
ccountHolderType":"O","negotiatedTradeFlag":false}  
 
JSON Data File examples in this document are shown on multiple lines for readability only. 
6.1.2.3. CSV Format Submission Rules 
The following rules apply to the submission of Data Files in CSV format only: 
1.  The sequence of fields is fixed; the position of each field is relative to the beginning of its associated 
record. The format of every file and record must be in the sequence described within this document . 
2.  Each included field, except for the last field in a record, must be terminated by a delimiter including 
instances when the field is null or blank, is the maximum length, or is greyed out or Reserved for 
Future Use. 
a.  A record must include every specified field up to, and including, the last required field per the 
event definition. 
b.  When a field that is positioned after the last required field is populated, every field position after 
the last required field up to and including the last populated field must be delimited. 
For example: 
Event ABC is defined as having three fields: Allowable CSV Formats:     
Version 4.1.0 r4  317 
Seq Include Key 
1 R 
2 R 
3 C 
 
1, 2, 3, 
1, 2, 3 
1, 2, 
1, 2 
 
Event ABC is updated to include a new conditional field: 
Seq Include Key 
1 R 
2 R 
3 C 
4 C 
 
Allowable CSV Formats: 
1, 2, 3, 4, 
1, 2, 3, 4 
1, 2, 3, 
1, 2, 3 
1, 2, 
1, 2 
 
Event ABC is updated to include a new required field: 
Seq Include Key 
1 R 
2 R 
3 C 
4 C 
5 R 
 
Allowable CSV Formats: 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  No field in the record can contain any character used as a delimiter. 
4.  The last field in a record is not required to be terminated by a field delimiter. The field will still be 
considered to be acceptable if the delimiter is included.  
5.  The field delimiter is a comma (ASCII decimal 44, hex 2C). 
6.  Other delimiters defined for usage include the ‘|’ (pipe), ‘@’ (at sign) and ‘ “ ‘ (double quotes). Use of 
‘|’ and ‘@’ have been specified for reporting complex data types where a field contains multiple 
values. Refer to Section 2.5: Data Types. 
7.  Each record must end with an end-of-record marker (ASCII LF or CR/LF). 
8.  Optional (O) and Conditional fields (C) are omitted by only including the delimiter.   
9.  Required (R) fields must contain an appropriate value and be terminated by the delimiter.  
10.  Values do not need to fill the entire data type length of the field; Values may not exceed the data type 
length.  
11.  Leading zeros will be removed during processing from fields that are a Data Type of Numeric. 
Leading zeros will NOT be removed from fields that are any other Data Type, such as Text or 
Alphanumeric. Refer to Section 2.5: Data Types. 
12.  Leading and trailing blanks will be removed during processing from fields that are a Data Type of Text 
or Alphanumeric; blanks populated within such fields will NOT be removed. Leading and trailing     
Version 4.1.0 r4  318 
blanks will NOT be removed from fields that are any other Data Type, such as Numeric. Refer to 
Section 2.5: Data Types. 
6.1.3. Metadata File Submission 
Effective July 24, 2023, the Metadata File submission associated with the Data File will no longer be 
supported. If a Metadata file is submitted on or after July 24, 2023, it will be rejected at the File 
Acknowledgement stage of processing.                                                    
6.1.4. Data File Submission 
The following rules apply to the submission of Data Files: 
1. All Data Files sent from the CAT Reporter (or CAT Reporting Agent for the CAT Reporter) must be 
compressed using BZip2. The associated compression extension is “bz2”. 
2. Files must be individually compressed and submitted. Compressed files may not be bundled into a 
single container file. 
3. All events within the file must be for the same CAT Reporter IMID. However, Industry Member 
Identifiers populated in the senderIMID, receiverIMID and destination fields may be different. 
4. Files submitted through SFTP are limited to a maximum uncompressed size of 100GB.  
5. Larger file submissions are recommended to reduce number of files for Reporters to transfer and 
manage and to allow feedback to be returned consistently and faster.  
6. Files submitted through the CAT Reporter Portal are limited to a maximum uncompressed size of 
1GB, with a record limit of 100,000 records per file. Files with more than 100,000 records will be 
rejected. 
7. Schema files will be maintained by the Plan Processor and will be versioned as the Technical 
Specifications change. 
8. Files may contain events for any Event Date that is less than or equal to the date on which the file is 
processed.  
9. Events within a file may be in any sequence. 
10. Files may contain original submissions, firm-initiated corrections, CAT error corrections and record 
delete instructions.  
11. Files are recommended to contain data for the same CAT Trading Day to ensure the usage of the File 
Delete Instruction. Refer to Section 7.6.4. This is not a requirement. 
12. Empty Data Files will be accepted. 
13. Data Files are processed independently. Effective July 24, 2023, the Metadata File submission 
associated with the Data File will no longer be supported. 
14. The processing date of all submissions will be assigned based on the received timestamp of the Dat a 
File. If a Data File is received after T+1 @ 8:00 AM ET, the submissions will be considered late.

6.1.5. Schema 
An Industry Member Schema file that details the structure and expected contents of every message type 
is available on the CAT public website. The schema file will be maintained by the Plan Processor and will 
be versioned as the message specifications change.  
6.1.5.1. Schema Version 
Schema changes will be updated when changes to the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for 
Industry Members occur that impact the schema. The following rules apply:  
1. The Schema Version is assigned to a File Kind. The events within this Technical Specifications are 
assigned to File Kind ‘OrderEvents’. 
2. The Schema Version is formatted as <Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>. All digits must be represented.  
o Major – updated when a change occurs that impacts all or a significant portion of Industry 
Member CAT Reporters. In such cases, the schema is not backward compatible and will be 
specified accordingly. 
o Minor – updated when a change occurs that does not require coding changes for all Industry 
Member CAT Reporters. In such cases, the schema is backward compatible with support for 
previous version(s) as specified.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  320 
o Patch – updated when a change occurs that does not require coding changes for any 
Industry Member CAT Reporters.  
o Revision – not part of the Schema Version. Used to represent updates to the Industry 
Member Technical Specifications which do not impact the Schema definition. Revision added 
to the end of the Schema Version as <Schema Version> r<#>. 
3. Records contained in a Data File must be formatted as per the Schema Version outlined in these 
Technical Specifications based on the applicable Environment.

6.2. Connectivity  
Connectivity to CAT will be through at least one of the following methods:     
Version 4.1.0 r4  322 
• Private Line provided by a Managed Network Service Provider (MNSP)  
• AWS PrivateLink 
• CAT Secure Reporting Gateway (SRG) Reporter Portal 
Both the Private Line and AWS PrivateLink connectivity methods will support the CAT File Transfer 
service, which provides access for automated, machine-to-machine file submissions, acknowledgements, 
rejections, and corrections using the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) service as well as to the CAT 
Reporter Portal for interactive reporting through web-based forms or manual file uploads. 
The CAT Secure Reporting Gateway (SRG) connectivity method will only support the CAT Report Portal. 
The SRG requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) to establish a secure, encrypted session before 
accessing the CAT Reporter Portal. The SRG requires the use of modern browsers supporting HTML5 
and TLS (Transport Layer Security). No client software installation is required.  
The combinations of Connectivity and Interface Methods are summarized below.

6.3.1. CAT File Transfer  
The CAT File Transfer method is an automated, machine-to-machine interface utilizing the Secure File 
Transfer Protocol (“SFTP”) for file submissions, acknowledgements, rejections and corrections. SFTP 
enables Industry Members and CAT Reporting Agents to create machine-to-machine connections to 
securely transmit data and retrieve data from FINRA CAT.  
The following is the SFTP directory structure that will be made available in the submitter’s home directory. 
Files associated with data submissions and associated feedback will be uploaded in SFTP directories as 
per the following table. 
Table 147: SFTP Directories 
SFTP Directory Usage 
/submitterID/cat/upload SFTP submissions uploaded by Submitters of Data Files. CAT will 
move files from this directory for further processing. 
/submitterID/cat/feedback Meta Feedback files associated with each processing state. 
/submitterID/cat/errors Error Data Feedback Files containing errors generated during 
Ingestion and Linkage Discovery. 
 
The following rules apply: 
1. Processing is initiated when a file appears in the /submitterID/cat/upload directory.  
2. CAT will remove files from the upload directory as soon as each file upload is complete.       
Version 4.1.0 r4  324 
3. The Submitter must not delete files from the /submitterID/cat/upload directory. 
 
6.3.2. CAT Reporter Portal 
The CAT Reporter Portal is a web interface utilizing secure encryption protocols (HTTPS/TLS) and multi -
factor authentication (MFA). The CAT Reporter Portal will facilitate data submissions using the following 
methods:  
• Manual upload of Data Files up to 1GB in size and limited to 100,000 records meeting all 
requirements as specified in Section 6: Submission Process. 
• Data entry for original submissions, repairs for CAT-identified errors, firm-initiated corrections and 
deletion instructions. These entries will be converted to Data Files by the portal; Data Files will be 
available for view and download via the Portal for a specified time period.  
6.4. CAT Reporting Hours  
6.4.1. Submission of CAT Events 
Pursuant to SEC Rule 613, the CAT NMS Plan requires Industry Members to record order, quote, 
fulfillment and trade events. Real-time reporting to CAT is not required. Data may be bulk uploaded at the 
end of the Trading Day, or may be submitted in batches with associated uploads throughout the day. All 
Reportable Events for a Trading Day are required to be reported to CAT by 8:00 AM ET on the next 
Trading Day. 
Trading Day for Industry Members is defined as: 
• Start: immediately after 4:15:00 PM and no fractions of a second Eastern Time on one trade date  
• End: exactly 4:15:00 PM and no fraction of a second Eastern Time on the next trade date 
(T=Trading Day, a defined term)16,17  
 
 
16 Note that the Trading Day definition for Participants is different. It starts on 1 millisecond from 12:00AM of T, and ends at 12:00AM 
of T+1. 
17 A Trading Day which is also an early close will end 15 minutes after market close.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  325 
The Trading Day is used to determine the reporting deadline of CAT events, including when all error 
repairs and firm initiated corrections are due. Weekends or any day that all equities or options national 
securities exchanges are closed are not considered a Trading Day.  
CAT accepts submissions (via SFTP and the CAT Reporter Portal) 24 hours per day, 6 days per week 
beginning at 12:01 AM ET on Monday and ending at 11:59 PM ET on Saturday. Events that occurred 
during a particular CAT Trading Day may be reported anytime between the time the event occurred and 
the reporting deadline, which is 8:00 AM ET on the next Trading Day. Reports received after the deadline 
will be considered late. 
The table below provides examples of the reporting deadline.

6.4.3. Deadline for Firm Initiated Corrections and Deletions 
CAT specifications allow for Industry Members to correct and delete events that did not produce an error 
during processing. All such corrections must be submitted within the same correction deadline as 
described in Section 6.4.2.  
6.5. Security 
6.5.1. Encryption (In-transit) 
TLS-based encryption, version 1.2 minimum, is required for connection to the Reporter Portal (whether 
accessed via private line or the SRG) and to the Security Reporter Gateway itself.  
For SFTP, in addition to the fact that the SFTP service is only accessible via private line, traffic will be 
encrypted by virtue of the intrinsic encryption capabilities of SFTP. AES256 will be supported for SFTP; 
support for other encryption protocols is under evaluation. 
6.5.2. Encryption (At-rest) 
The CAT system will use native AWS encryption features to encrypt data upon receipt. No action is 
required by the Industry Member. 
6.5.3. Authentication 
Two-factor authentication will be required for access to the Reporter Portal. The first factor will be 
username and password which will require periodic rotation. 
The second factor will to be via push notification to an off-the-shelf application installed on a mobile 
device provided by the user. The user will be required to install the application to their mobile device     
Version 4.1.0 r4  327 
through their mobile operating system’s application store and then complete a registration process on the 
Reporter Portal or SRG. There is no cost to the Reporter or the user for this mobile application.  
The SFTP service similarly requires that two conditions be met to access the interface.  The first factor is 
authentication via username and password. The second is the use of a defined IP source address that is 
established during initial onboarding. The SFTP system implements an IP whitelist that prevents access 
from any system not on the whitelist. 
More detailed information related to Security is described in the FINRA CAT Connectivity Supplement for 
Industry Members available at https://www.catnmsplan.com/registration/.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  328 
7. Feedback and Corrections 
CAT provides feedback associated with CAT submissions for CAT Reporters and Submitters including:  
• File Status: available via SFTP and the CAT Reporter Portal, indicates the acceptance or 
associated errors with a Data File submission. 
• Reporting Statistics: available via the CAT Reporter Portal, daily summary statistics 
representing reporting activity and errors for prior submissions and CAT Trading days. Error Rate 
is also included.  
• Error Feedback: available via SFTP and the CAT Reporter Portal, errors found during 
processing will be made available including Rejections, Out of Sequence, and Unlinked events.  
• Corrections Feedback: available via the CAT Reporter Portal, information is provided for the 
repair status of all Corrections. When an error has been corrected, the updated status will be 
reflected. 
• System Status and Announcements: available via the CAT Reporter Portal, the status of CAT 
processing will be made available with a distinction for instances when a processing delay or 
issue is occurring. Additionally, announcements related to system maintenance and upcoming 
changes will be presented. 
This section describes the procedures for obtaining feedback and making corrections/deletions 
associated with feedback of errors. Additionally this section describes the requirement for making 
correction/deletions for accepted data for which there was no feedback.  
7.1. File and Error Feedback 
Feedback files with associated errors are generated at different stages of processing and returned to the 
CAT Reporter and Submitter.  
Feedback for the File Acknowledgement and File Integrity phases will be provided via a Meta Feedback 
File, indicating success or indicating failure and all associated errors. 
Feedback for Ingestion and Linkage Discovery will be provided via: 
• A Meta Feedback File, indicating success or failure. 
• One or more Error Data Feedback Files, indicating all error for and the original content of each 
record with one or more associated errors, preformatted for resubmission to CAT.  
Errors identified during each processing stage will be provided in the following order with the associated  
Feedback and Error Correction availability:

7.1.1. Feedback Generation 
Feedback associated with all processing stages will be made available via SFTP and/or the CAT 
Reporter Portal as described in Table 146: CAT Data and Feedback Interface Methods. 
For feedback files made available via SFTP, the following rules apply: 
1. The format of feedback files will match the format of the original file submission.  
2. Meta Feedback Files will be accessible under the cat/feedback directory in the Submitter’s home 
directory on the Feedback SFTP server. 
3. Error Data Feedback Files will be accessible under the cat/errors directory in the Submitter’s 
home directory on the Feedback SFTP server.  
4. Feedback for data submitted by a CAT Reporting Agent on behalf of a CAT Reporter will be 
accessible under the CAT Reporter’s home directory on the Feedback SFTP server if the CAT 
Reporter has an SFTP account. 
5. If a file is rejected, it will not proceed to the next processing stage. 
6. Error Data Feedback Files generated during Data Ingestion and Linkage Discovery will be 
compressed. Each line in the file will contain exactly one record ending with a new-line character. 
7. The minimum retention time for feedback files on the SFTP server is 10 calendar days. After that 
time, they may be removed from the server. Feedback will be available via the CAT Reporter Portal 
for at least 90 days.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  330

7.3. File Integrity 
During the File Integrity processing stage, file names are validated for uniqueness. Filenames are 
validated to ensure they are readable, formatted as expected.  
The following rules apply to File Integrity: 
1. All Data Files with a Success status generated during File Acknowledgement will enter the File 
Integrity processing stage.  
2. File Integrity feedback file will include the file extension .integrity. 
3. Data File names which duplicate prior submissions accepted during File Integrity will  be rejected. 
4. Data Files which include invalid values in the file name will be rejected. 
5. The CAT Submitter ID of the Data File must be equal to the Submitter ID of the submitter that sent 
the files (as determined from SFTP or CAT Reporter Portal username).  
6. If the CAT Submitter is reporting on behalf of the CAT Reporter IMID, a Reporting Relationship must 
be effective.

7.4. Data Ingestion  
During Data Ingestion, events within the Data File are validated. Validations to ensure correct syntax and 
semantics associated with record length, field length, data type, non-null and reference data checks are 
performed. Validations are initiated by the Action Type and Event Type of every record contained in the 
file. Ingestion feedback will be provided with reference to the file in which the data was transmitted.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  338 
During the ingestion phase, each record will be checked for proper formatting (JSON field names and 
values, CSV values in correct positions) and data contents. 
The following rules apply for Data Ingestion:  
1. File Ingestion feedback will be generated for every Data File for which a Success status was 
generated during File Integrity. The feedback will consist of a Meta Feedback File and an Error Data 
Feedback File when errors are found.  
2. Meta Feedback Files for Ingestion will include the file extension .ingestion. 
3. Error Data Feedback Files for Ingestion will include the file extension .ingestion.error. 
4. Data Files which are not readable will be rejected. Records within the file will not be processed. The 
file must be resubmitted. The provided Meta Feedback File will include the error code associated with 
the file error (Error Code 2153). 
5. Any record within a Data File determined to be malformed or otherwise invalid will be rejected.  
6. When a record is readable and can be parsed, Ingestion validations will occur for every field within 
the record. 
7. One or more errors may be found within a record. 
8. Records with one or more associated errors found during Ingestion will be rejected and will NOT 
participate in Linkage Discovery. 
9. Record rejections will be provided in feedback with the generation of a Meta Feedback File and an 
Error Data Feedback File that includes the error records. 
10. Ingestion error feedback will provide up to eight (8) error codes per record. If more than eight error 
are identified for a record, the eighth error code will inform the user that there are additional errors 
associated with the record that were not included in the feedback file. 
11. When an error record that was originally submitted in CSV format is readable and pars eable, the error 
feedback will be returned from the 3rd position.  
12. When an error record that was originally submitted in CSV format is not readable, the original record 
submitted to CAT will be returned.  
13. When an error is found for events originally submitted in JSON format, the original record submitted 
to CAT will be returned and will be formatted as a string using JSON rules.  
14. Records that are not rejected during Data Ingestion will participate in Linkage Discovery.

7.5. Linkage Discovery 
During Linkage Discovery, events are compared with other events to perform duplicate checks, out of 
sequence checks and linkages among events having the same Linkage Keys. The linkage types 
performed by CAT are defined in Section 2.6. 
Linkage Discovery processing will occur in the following order:  
Table 157: Steps in Linkage Discovery 
Seq Linkage Discovery Step Feedback 
1 Full Duplicate Checks When duplicates are found, one record is kept and all others are rejected 
2 Order Key, Trade Key, Quote 
Key and Fulfillment Key 
Duplicate Checks 
When an Event Key is duplicated, all events having the same key are rejected 
3 Intrafirm Linkage, Out of 
Sequence, and FDID 
Validation 
Events within a firm that do not match or are found to be out of sequence result 
in an unlinked event. Events are sequenced to the maximum timestamp 
granularity provided in the event. 
Additionally, events where the FDID provided does not exist in the CAIS data or 
is not valid on the specified date will result in an FDID validation error. Events 
receiving an FDID validation error will participate in all linkage processing. 
For RFQ responses that are communicated in standard electronic format directly 
to an Industry Member’s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not 
“immediately actionable” (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be 
executed/routed), ), which are not required to be reported to CAT until August 1, 
2026, Intrafirm Linkage validations are enabled beginning July 29, 2024. 
Interfirm Linkage Events routed/received between firms that do not match result in an unlinked 
event, including Route Key duplicate checks. 
For RFQ responses that are communicated in standard electronic format directly 
to an Industry Member’s OMS/EMS or to an RFQ platform and that are not 
“immediately actionable” (i.e., further action is required before a trade can be 
executed/routed), ), which are not required to be reported to CAT until August 1, 
2026, Interfirm Linkage errors validations will be suppressed in scenarios where 
a quote event is routed to, or received from, Industry Members. 
Exchange Linkage Events routed to an Exchange that do not match result in an unlinked event, 
including Route Key duplicate checks 
Trade Linkage Trade events which name a TRF/ORF/ADF record that do not match result in an 
unlinked event 
 
The following rules apply for Linkage Discovery: 
1. Linkage Discovery processing will be performed for all events which pass Ingestion.  
2. Linkage feedback files will include the file extension .linkage. 
3. Linkage feedback error files will include the file extension .linkage.error.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  343 
4. Linkage feedback error summary files will include the file extension 
.linkage.error.summary. 
5. A linkage feedback error summary file is provided when one or more FDID validation errors exist 
for a processing date. 
6. The CATReporterIMID and all fields included on the original submission, except for the 
firmROEID participate in full duplicate checking. 
7. When full duplicates are identified, one event will be kept and all other events which fully 
duplicate the record will be rejected when submitted within the Processing Window. Full 
duplicates submitted outside the Processing Window will be marked late. 
8. When Event Key duplicates are identified, all events having the duplicated key will result in 
rejections for all records with the same key. 
9. Events that passed Event Key duplicate validations participate in the process which generates 
linkages.  
10. When Linkage Key duplicates are identified, all events having the duplicated Linkage Key will 
result in in unlinked errors for all records with the same key. 
11. When linkages are expected but do not occur, a linkage error will be generated reflecting an 
unlinked event.  
12. In cases when linkage did not occur between venues, unlinked feedback will be generated for the 
CAT Reporter whose record did not link and the CAT Reporter that was named. Separate error 
codes will be assigned.  
13. One or more linkage errors may be found within a record.  
14. Named errors are considered repaired when the unlinked event is repaired. 
15. Linkage feedback for unlinked errors will be provided in the submission format of the unlinked 
event, including named unlinked errors. 
16. Linkage feedback for named unlinked errors will be provided in the format of the original 
submission unless the CAT Reporter specifies a preference for named unlinked errors that is 
different than the unlinked errors on the CAT Reporter Portal. 
17. Linkage Discovery Error Data Feedback Files will be limited to an uncompressed file size of 1GB.  
18. Multiple Unlinked Error Data Feedback Files will be provided to ensure the file size maximum is 
not exceeded. The File Feedback number will be incremented to ensure the feedback file name is 
not duplicated. 
19. When there are no Linkage Discovery Errors, an empty file will be returned with a .success 
extension. 
20. Linkage Feedback Files are named by CAT. These feedback files represent Linkage Feedback 
across all submissions for the CATReporterIMID/Submitter combination. The Feedback is not 
associated with specific submission file(s). The file name includes the Processing Date for which 
the Unlinked Feedback represents.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  344 
21. Linkage Feedback Files present linkage fields as they were ingested, not as they were processed 
for linkage. For example, leading and trailing zeros on a routedOrderID or session will be 
reflected in Linkage Feedback Files as they were ingested although they are removed for linkage 
processing. 
7.5.1. Linkage Discovery Feedback Definitions 
Linkage Discovery Errors include unlinked events reported by the CAT Reporter, and unlinked events on 
which the CAT Reporter was named. For named linkage errors, a subset of fields will be provided.  Refer 
to CAT Alert 2019-04 for additional information on named linkage errors.   
There are six types of Unlinked Data errors including:

7.6. Corrections 
Errors found during CAT processing and found by CAT Reporters subsequent to transmission must be 
repaired. The reporting of Error Corrections is facilitated in CAT through submissions via SFTP and the 
CAT Reporter Portal. Certain fields are defined within the Event definitions in Section 4 Equity Events, 
and Section 5 Option Events, to facilitate the reporting of corrections including: actionType, firmROEID, 
errorROEID.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  356 
Corrections may be reported for any previously submitted event. A corrected record will replace the 
original record for all further processing when the corrected record is received prior to T+4. The following 
scenarios are supported: 
• Repair of events for which a CAT Error was provided in feedback 
• Correction of events initiated by firms for which there is no associated CAT error feedback  
• Deletion of a single event to remove erroneous events which did or did not result in a CAT Error  
• Deletion of a file, resulting in the deletion of all events and respective CAT Errors  
• The reporting of corrections may occur on the same CAT Processing Date as the original 
submission 
7.6.1. Repair CAT Errors 
A repair is instructed when repairing events for which a CAT Error was provided in feedback. The 
following rules apply: 
1. A Repair record must contain the actionType ‘RPR’ 
2. Repair records must populate the errorROEID equal to the errorROEID value provided by CAT in 
the respective error feedback; otherwise the record will be rejected. 
3. Repair records may be reported within Data Files, among other CAT action types. 
4. A Repair record must be reported for CAT Errors generated as a result of a record that is not 
readable, or when the record has an error associated with the eventTimestamp, or firmROEID. 
5. CAT errors for which a Repair record is processed will be considered repaired.  
6. CAT errors for which a Repair record is processed after T+3 @ 8:00 AM ET will be considered as 
a late repair. 
7. Repair records processed prior to T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET will result in the elimination of the 
previously submitted record from further processing. 
8. Repair records processed after T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET will be appended to the audit trail.  
9. In cases where an Industry Member receives an ingestion error on a repair record that was 
intended to correct a Linker error, two separate errors exist in CAT. To repair these errors, the 
following actions can be taken: 
• If both submissions that resulted in the errors were submitted with the same firmROEID, then 
a single repair submission can repair both errors. Industry Members must report the 
Correction using actionType COR populated with the firmROEID of the errors, which will 
resolve both errors. 
• If the two original submissions that resulted in the errors were not submitted with the same 
firmROEID, then two actions are required. Industry Members must submit a Delete instruction 
for one of the errors, and submit a Repair or Correction for the other.

7.6.2. Firm Initiated Corrections 
A firm initiated correction is instructed for correcting events for which there is no associated CAT error 
feedback or the firm repairs an error without submitting an errorROEID. The following rules apply: 
1. A firm initiated correction record must contain the actionType ‘COR’. 
2. Firm initiated correction records must assign the firmROEID equal to the firmROEID of the 
original submission, otherwise the record will be rejected. 
3. Firm initiated corrections must be used for correcting events for which there is no associated CAT 
error. 
4. Firm initiated corrections may be used to repair an event for which a CAT Error was provided in 
feedback. 
5. Firm initiated corrections may be reported within Data Files, among other CAT event types.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  358 
6. Events for which a firm initiated correction is processed by T+3 @ 8:00 AM ET will be considered 
corrected. 
7. Events for which a firm initiated correction is processed after T+3 @ 8:00 AM ET will be 
considered as a late correction. 
8. Events for which a firm initiated correction is processed prior to T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET will result in 
the elimination of the previously submitted record from further processing. 
9. Events for which a firm initiated correction processed after T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET will be appended 
to the audit trail.  
10. Firm identified errors associated with the CAT Reporter IMID must be corrected using the Delete 
Instruction. Refer to Section 7.6.3 below.

7.6.3. Record Delete Instructions 
Record deletions are used to support the removal of one or more erroneous events reported to CAT. The 
following rules apply: 
• A delete instruction must contain the actionType ‘DEL’. 
• A delete instruction does not support the full restatement of the record that is being deleted.  
• Delete instructions associated with a CAT error may populate the errorROEID equal to the 
errorROEID value provided by CAT in the respective error feedback OR may populate the firmROEID  
equal to the firmROEID of the original submission. 
• A Delete instruction for an event for which a CAT error was not generated must populate the 
firmROEID equal to the firmROEID of the original submission. 
• Delete instructions may be reported within Data Files, among other CAT event types. 
• CAT errors for which a Delete instruction is processed will be considered deleted.  
• CAT errors for which a Delete instruction is processed after to T+3 @ 8:00 AM ET will be considered 
as a late repair. 
• Delete instructions processed prior to T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET will result in the elimination of the 
previously submitted record from further processing. 
• Delete instructions processed after T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET will be appended to the audit trail. 
• A firmROEID used in a CAT record for which received a Delete instruction was reported may be re-
used after the Delete instruction is processed. 
• Repair or Delete instructions for CAT errors where the CAT record was malformed or had an error 
associated with the eventTimestamp or firmROEID must be reporting using the error ROE ID 
provided by CAT.

7.6.4. File Deletion 
File Deletion is used to support the deletion of all events within a single Data File, including all respective 
CAT errors for those events. File Deletions are used for files with included Event data representing an 
Event Date that is prior to T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET. Deletion of events for Event Dates after T+4 @ 8:00 AM 
ET is possible using the Delete Record instructions described in Section 7.6.3. 
The following rules apply for file deletions: 
1. Data Files must be deleted individually by the original Submitter of the file. Blocks are not supported.  
2. File Acknowledgement and File Integrity feedback will be generated for every file delete instruction 
submitted by the firm. 
3. After the File Delete Instruction has been acknowledged, a firmROEID that was contained in the file 
being deleted can be reused in a new submission. 
4. The file deletion process will not be supported after T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET. All events contained in the 
original file for which the file delete instruction was received, must represent a CAT Trading Day that 
is prior to T+4 @ 8:00 AM ET.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  361 
5. File deletions are not supported for events with an Action Type of COR, DEL or RPR. All events 
contained with the original file for which the file deletion instruction was received, must have an Action 
Type of NEW. 
6. Records contained in the original file being deleted will be removed from further processing and 
related CAT Errors will be considered as deleted. 
7. Filenames must not be reused, even after a file is deleted. 
8. Delete file instructions are reported by submitting an empty Data File named as:  
<file base name of original Data File>.DEL.<Format Extension>.<Compression Extension>: 
File Deletion (JSON) 
Data File Name SUBID_MYID_20190207_OrderEvents_000002.DEL.json.bz2 
Data File Contents Empty file 
 
7.6.5. Same Day Corrections 
When error feedback is received, the CAT Reporter can take immediate action which may result in the 
original submission and correction occurring during the same processing date.  Additionally, there will be 
instances when a Submitter identifies a CAT submissions issue for which CAT error feedback is expected 
but has not yet been received. In such cases, it is also possible to submit a same day correction.  
Although the CAT Processor design processes data submissions in processing stages, the data within 
each stage does not have a prescribed processing order. To support the processing of same day 
corrections for which error feedback has not been received, the following guidelines for usage of each 
correction mechanism are recommended: 
• File Deletion instructions may be reported any time subsequent to the delivery of File Integrity 
feedback of the associated file. 
• Record deletions may be instructed after receiving File Ingestion feedback for the file in which the 
record was submitted. 
• Firm initiated corrections may be reported after receiving File Ingestion feedback for the file in which 
the record was submitted. 
     
Version 4.1.0 r4  362 
8. Testing 
CAT will provide an environment for testing that mirrors the current functionality of the CAT P roduction 
Environment, as well as functionality for the next release version of the CAT environment when available. 
The CAT Test Environment will automatically determine which specification version Industry Members 
and CAT Reporting Agents are using for submissions. If error reporting formats change, Industry 
Members and CAT Reporting Agents will receive feedback in the current and new specification via sftp, 
as well as have access to current/new CAT Reporter portal URLs for specification changes that impact 
the CAT Reporter portal. Current/new connectivity changes will also be supported concurrently. 
The Test Environment performs lifecycle linkage, and Industry Members and CAT Reporting Agents are 
encouraged to coordinate testing with their counterparties so as to test lifecycle linkage with their 
counterparties. Without simultaneous contra-party reporting in the Test Environment, Industry Members 
and CAT Reporting Agents will not be able to test linkage with their counterparties.  Note that, effective 
May 16, 2022, Named Errors will be generated in the Test Environment only when the named 
organization has also submitted data to the Test Environment for the same Processing Date.  
Industry Members and CAT Reporting Agents must test their submissions using the T est Environment 
before they begin submitting to the Production Environment. 
The Test Environment is available 24 hours a day, 6 days a week. Refer to the CAT website for contact 
information and hours of operation for support. 
Industry Members and CAT Reporting Agents connect to the Test Environment in the same manner they 
would connect to the Production Environment. However, for the connection to the Test Environment, one 
or more alternate IP addresses or URLs may be used. 
Testing does not relieve an Industry Member of its responsibilities to submit production data to the CAT 
System.

Version 4.1.0 r4  366 
Appendix B: Clock Synchronization Requirement 
In previous sections, details are described regarding Order Events and data elements. Timestamp, as 
one of the required data elements for each order event, must be correctly reported by Industry Members 
at predefined granularity. This section provides an overview of the corresponding clock synchronization 
requirements applicable to Industry Members. 
In order to comply with applicable requirements of Clock Synchronization and correctly record the 
Timestamp fields for order events. Industry Members are required to synchronize Business Clocks at a 
minimum to within 50 milliseconds of the time maintained by the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) and to maintain such synchronization. Business Clocks that are solely used for 
Manual CAT events or for the time of allocation on Allocation Reports must be synchronized at a 
minimum to within a one second tolerance.  
The tolerance includes: 
• The difference between the NIST standard and a time provider’s clock; 
• Transmission delay from the source; and 
• The amount of drift in the Participant's clock. 
To ensure the accuracy of timestamps for Reportable Events, Industry Members must document and 
maintain their synchronization procedures for Business Clocks. Industry Members must keep a log of the 
time when they synchronize their Business Clocks and the results of the synchronization process. This 
log must include notice of any time a Business Clock drifts more than the applicable tolerances specified 
above. Such log must include results for a period of time of not less than five years ending on the then 
current date, or for the entire period for which the Industry Member has been required to comply with this 
Rule if less than five years. Industry Members must also certify their compliance with these clock 
synchronization requirements and report violations according to requirements established by the 
Operating Committee.  
Any time provider and technology may be used for clock synchronization as long as the Business Clocks 
are in compliance with the accuracy requirement.  
If additional details are needed, refer to Participants' applicable rules.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  367 
Appendix C: Representative Order Linkages  
The CAT NMS Plan requires that customer/client orders be linked to representative orders created in firm 
accounts for the purpose of facilitating the execution of a customer/client order. This Appendix outlines 
reporting requirements for creating linkages between customer/client and representative orders.  
C.1 Representative Order Reporting Requirements  
C.1.1 Representative Order Reporting  
Representative orders must be reported to CAT and marked as a representative order using the 
representativeInd field on New Order events.  
The table below describes the representativeInd field values: 
Table 166: representativeInd Field Values 
Value Definition Explanation 
Equities Values 
Y Representative order, linkage required This value must be used for representative orders where linkage is 
required as described below. 
YS Representative order, linkage required; 
details in supplement event 
This value must be used if a firm provides aggregated order IDs on 
an order supplement event. 
YP Representative order, pricing guarantee, 
no linkage required 
This value must be used when a firm receives a customer/client 
order, guarantees an execution price (e.g., VWAP) and then 
originates proprietary orders in an effort to work the customer/client 
order. Linkage may not be possible as the customer/client order may 
not be filled from the proprietary orders if the guaranteed price is not 
achieved. 
All Industry Members will be required to provide representative order 
linkages to unlinked OMS/EMS and position fill scenarios no later 
than January 31, 2025 due to the expiry of the exemptive relief 
granted by the SEC on November 2, 2023. 
YE Representative eligible - Order eligible 
for customer/client fills via an unlinked 
system (unlinked OMS-EMS or position 
fill workflow) 
This value must be used to report proprietary orders that are 
originated as part of workflows where there is no systemic link 
between customer/client orders and representative firm orders and 
which includes disparate OMS-EMS scenarios and position fill 
workflows.  
In such workflows, MENO events for any street side orders reported 
with a YE indicator are not required to be linked to a customer/client 
order, and the aggregatedOrders field must be blank.  
All Industry Members will be required to provide representative order 
linkages to unlinked OMS/EMS and position fill scenarios no later 
than January 31, 2025 due to the expiry of the exemptive relief 
granted by the SEC on November 2, 2023. 
Options Values 
O Options combined order, linkage 
required 
This value must be used for options combined orders where linkage 
is required.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  368 
Value Definition Explanation 
OS Options combined order, linkage 
required; details in a supplement event 
This value must be used for options combined orders where a firm 
provides aggregated order IDs on an options order supplement 
event.  
Multi-Leg Values 
OML Multi-Leg Option combined order, 
linkage required/ 
This value must be used when multi-leg orders are combined into a 
single aggregated multi-leg order.  
OMS Options combined order, linkage 
required; details in a supplement event 
This value must be used for Multi-Leg options combined orders 
where a firm provides aggregated order IDs on a Multi-Leg Order 
Supplement event. 
Common Values – Applicable to both Equities and Options 
N Not a representative order/options 
combined order, linkage is not 
applicable 
The value of N must be provided on any order that a firm is able to 
explicitly determine is not a representative order or an options 
combined order. 
 
C.1.2 Representative Order Linkages 
Linkage is required between the representative street side order and the order being represented for both 
executed and unexecuted orders. Executed orders must also have a link between the Order Fulfillment 
event for the customer/client order and the representative order from which the fill came.  
The following fields are used in the linkage process: 
At the Order Level 
• representativeInd indicates if an order was originated to represent a customer/client order. 
• aggregatedOrders specifies the original order IDs and quantities being consolidated in the 
representative order. 
At the Order Fulfillment Level 
• orderID contains the firm side order that was used to fill the customer/client order.  
• fulfillmentLinkType indicates whether there is order level and trade level linkage, only trade level 
linkage (e.g., fill from the pre-existing customer/client order), or why the firm side details are not 
present. 
• FDID contains the firm account that was used to fill the customer/client order (only applicable 
when a fulfillmentLinkType of ‘YE’ or ‘YP’ is populated). However, all Industry Members will be 
required to provide representative order linkages to unlinked OMS/EMS and position fill scenarios 
no later than January 31, 2025 due to the expiry of the exemptive relief granted by the SEC on 
November 2, 2023. 
• Linkage on the Order Fulfillment is indicated by the fulfillmentLinkType.     
Version 4.1.0 r4  369 
The following table describes the fulfillmentLinkType field values: 
Table 167: fulfillmentLinkType Field Values 
Value Definition Explanation 
Equities Values 
Y Representative order, linkage 
required 
This value must be used for representative orders where linkage is 
required. If this value is used, the orderID field in the firm side details is 
required to be populated. 
YS Customer/Client order filled 
from multiple representative 
orders, linkage required; 
details provided in a 
supplement event 
This value must be used when a customer/client order is filled from multiple 
representative orders. If this value is used, firmDetails in the MEOF event 
must be blank, and the details of each representative order used to fill the 
customer/client order must be provided in a MEOFS event. 
YP Fill from pre-existing Principal 
order, linkage required 
This value must be used when a customer/client order is filled from a 
proprietary order or pre-existing quote that was originated prior to receipt of 
the customer/client order. For example, this value must be used when a 
customer/client order is filled as a result of a Manning obligation and the 
proprietary order was not reported to CAT with the customer/client order ID 
in the aggregatedOrders field.  
All Industry Members will be required to provide representative order 
linkages to unlinked OMS/EMS and position fill scenarios no later than 
January 31, 2025 due to the expiry of the exemptive relief granted by the 
SEC on  November 2, 2023. 
YE Representative eligible - 
Order eligible for 
customer/client fills via an 
unlinked system (unlinked 
OMS-EMS or position fill 
workflow) 
This value must be used to report proprietary orders that are originated as 
part of workflows where there is no systemic link between customer/client 
orders and representative firm orders and which includes disparate OMS-
EMS scenarios and position fill workflows.  
In such workflows, MEOF events for any customer/client orders that are 
filled from a representative order reported with a YE indicator are required 
to contain the FDID of the firm account from which the order was filled. In 
addition, the accountHolderType must be populated with the type of firm 
account. 
All Industry Members will be required to provide representative order 
linkages to unlinked OMS/EMS and position fill scenarios no later than 
January 31, 2025 due to the expiry of the exemptive relief granted by the 
SEC on  November 2, 2023. 
FOR Fulfillment on an order routed 
to a foreign destination, no 
linkage required 
This value must be used to report the fill of an order (customer/client or 
proprietary) that was routed to a foreign destination. When a value of FOR 
is populated, the firmDetails must be blank.

Appendix E: Error Codes 
This section defines the error and warning codes generated by CAT. Each code is defined to include the reason 
for the error or warning, including the associated fields. Warnings are not subject to further processing and firms 
are not required to take any action on them. Codes are assigned in ranges to represent similar types of errors 
within the same range, related by validation type and/or by linkage type. Codes are organized by the CAT 
Processing stages including: 
• File Integrity 
• Data Ingestion 
• Linkage Discovery 
E.1 File Integrity Errors

E.3 Linkage Discovery Errors 
Linkage Discovery errors are generated by performing event comparisons that result in the identification of 
duplicates, out of sequence events and unlinked events. To identify duplicate Linkage Keys, the CAT Processor 
will ensure the CAT Linkage Keys, as defined in Section 2.6.1, are not repeated.  
Unlinked error codes are assigned based on a processing order when determining the reason for an unlinked 
event. The process begins with the check associated with the codes having the lowest sequence value. When the 
“Multiple Fields did not Match” reason is assigned, it is because a determination could not be made. In such 
cases, it is possible that the unlink reason is because the other party’s event was not reported or had a 
processing error which prevented the event from participating in Linkage Discovery.  
In cases when linkage did not occur between venues, separate error codes will be assigned to the CAT 
Reporter whose record did not link and the CAT Reporter that was named. Error Code Descriptions that 
begin with “Named” indicate when the CAT Reporter was named in a record submitted by another CAT 
Reporter (Industry Member, Exchange or TRF/ADF/ORF) that is unlinked. Refer to CAT Alert 2019-04 for 
additional information on named linkage errors.   
Note: Named Errors for Exchange Trade Linkage breaks (exchange floor trade events where a corresponding 
MOOT event is missing) are not currently available.   
The below tables contain error messages that are associated with Linkage Discovery Errors.

Appendix F: Glossary 
Term Definition 
CAT Processing Date Date representing the set of events reported for a CAT Trading Day. Events reported 
late to CAT will be assigned the CAT Processing Date reflective of when they were 
reported. For example, an event, that occurred at 2pm on T which is reported to CAT 
after T+1 @ 8:00 AM ET and prior to T+2 @ 8:00 AM ET will be assigned CAT 
Processing Date of T+1. 
CAT Reporter IMID The CAT Reporter IMID is the SRO-assigned identifier that an Industry Member 
uses to report CAT events. A CAT Reporter may use any SRO-assigned identifier 
that is valid on the CAT Trading Day for which CAT events are submitted.  
CAT Submitter ID The CAT Submitter ID is the identifier of the CAT Reporting Agent, the entity 
authorized to submit the files to CAT on behalf of the Industry Member.  
CAT Reporters may authorize third-parties (“CAT Reporting Agents”) to submit data 
to CAT on their behalf. Each CAT Reporting Agent and CAT Reporter will be 
assigned a unique CAT Submitter ID. If a CAT Reporter is performing its own 
submissions, these files will be submitted using its own CAT Submitter ID. 
If the Submitter is an Industry Member, the CAT Submitter’s CRD number. If the 
Submitter is not an Industry Member and does not have a CRD number (i.e., Service 
Bureaus), the CAT Submitter ID is the Submitter’s Organization ID. 
CAT Trading Day CAT Trading Day for Industry Members is defined as beginning immediately after 
4:15:00PM and no fractions of a second Eastern Time on one trade date and ending 
at exactly 4:15:00PM and no fractions of a second Eastern Time on the next trading 
date. 
Weekends or any day that all equities or options national securities exchanges are 
closed are not considered a CAT Trading Day. 
Trading Days that close early end 15 minutes after the Market Close. 
Client Order For the purpose of this document, Client Order is defined as an order received from 
a CAT Reporter. 
Customer Order For the purpose of this document, Customer Order is defined as an order received 
from a non-CAT Reporter, including non-US broker-dealers. 
Display ATS An ATS that displays subscriber orders outside of the ATS. 
Eligible Security "Eligible Security" includes: (i) all NMS Securities, meaning "any security or class of 
securities for which transaction reports are collected, processed, and made available 
pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan, or an effective national market 
system plan for reporting transaction in Listed Options"; and (ii) all OTC Equity 
Securities, meaning "any equity security, other than an NMS Security, subject to 
prompt last sale reporting rules of a registered national securities association and 
reported to one of such association's equity trade reporting facilities". 
Electronic Capture Time For manual orders, the timestamp or when the Manual CAT Event was captured 
electronically in the relevant order handling and execution system of the CAT 
Reporter. 
FDID FDID is defined in Section 1.1 of the CAT NMS Plan as "a unique identifier for each 
trading account designated by Industry Members for purposes of providing data to 
the Central Repository.” 
See CAT FAQ M2 for more information on the prohibition on use of actual account 
numbers. Refer to the CAT Industry Presentation on FDID for additional information.      
Version 4.1.0 r4  402 
IMID An Industry Member Identifier, IMID, is any identifier assigned by an SRO to one of 
its members and is used as part of the Linkage Key in orders routed between 
Industry Members. Examples include FINRA MPIDs, Nasdaq MPIDs, NYSE 
Mnemonics, Cboe EFIDs, and CHX Acronyms. 
Manual Event A non-electronic communication of order/trade/quote/fulfillment-related information 
for which CAT Reporters must record and report to CAT. 
Material Terms of an 
Order 
Includes: the NMS Security or OTC Equity Security symbol; security type; price (if 
applicable); size (displayed and non-displayed); side (buy/sell); order type; if a sell 
order, whether the order is long, short, short exempt; open/close indicator (except on 
transactions in equities); Time in Force (if applicable); if the order is for a Listed 
Option, option type (put/call), option symbol or root symbol, underlying symbol, strike 
price, expiration date, and open/close (except on market maker quotations); and any 
special handling instructions. 
Order The term order shall include: (i) Any order received by a member of a national 
securities exchange or national securities association from any person; (ii) Any order 
originated by a member of a national securities exchange or national securities 
association; or (iii) Any bid or offer.  
Paired Option Order For CAT reporting purposes, a Paired Option Order is defined as an electronic 
option order that contains both the initial and contra side that is routed as a single 
message to an exchange for crossing and/or price improvement. 
Primary Event An event that is received or originated by an Industry Member. Primary events 
include Orders, Trades, Quotes, Fulfillments and Allocations each with a respective 
Event Key including: Order Key, Trade Key, Quote Key, Quote Route Key, 
Fulfillment Key and Allocation Key.  
Primary events require the assignment of a unique Key which does not duplicate the 
Key for other Primary Events with the same Key type. For example, an Order Key 
will not be compared to a Trade Key for uniqueness. If an Event Key is duplicated, 
all events having the same Event Key will be rejected. 
Primary events include: MENO, MEOA, MENQ, MEQR, MEOT, MEOF, MONO, 
MOOA, MONQ, MOQR, MOOF, MOOT, MEPA, MOPA, MLNO, MLOA, MLNQ, and 
MLQR. 
Processing Window The Processing Window refers to the time period when data validation, linkage and 
corrections processing occurs prior to the construction of the lifecycle. The 
Processing Window for an event begins from the time it is reported to CAT and ends 
on the event’s Trade Date + 4 at 8am. 
Reportable Event Includes, but is not limited to, the original receipt or origination, modification, 
cancellation, routing, execution (in whole or in part) and allocation of an order, and 
receipt of a routed order 
Representative Order Refer to CAT FAQ F1. 
ROE Reportable Order Event 
Secondary Event Represents an event occurring subsequent to the origination of a Primary Event.  
Secondary events require the assignment of an Event Key which provides linkage to 
the related Primary event that assigned the Key or to another Secondary event that 
assigned a new Key. 
Secondary events with event definitions that do not allow for the reassignment of an 
Event Key must populate the Event Key equal to the related event from which the 
Secondary event originated. Secondary events that are not defined to assign a new 
Event Key include: MENOS, MEOR, MEMR, MEMRS, MECR, MECRS, MEORS,     
Version 4.1.0 r4  403

Secondary events with event definitions that allow for the reassignment of an Event 
Key (Order Key, Trade Key, Quote Key, Quote Route Key, Fulfillment Key and 
Allocation Key) must assign an Event Key that is unique and does not duplicate the 
Event Key of any other Primary event or of any Secondary event which has assigned 
a new Event Key. When a new Event Key is assigned, the Prior Key representing 
the Event Key that is being replaced must be populated. Secondary events with 
event definitions that allow for the reassignment of an Event Key include: MEIR, 
MEIM, MECO, MECOM, MEOM, MEOJ, MEQM, MEFA, MEAA, MEOE, MOIR, 
MOIM, MOCO, MOCOM, MOOM, MOQM, MOOJ, MOFA, MOAA, MOOE, MLIR, 
MLIM, MLCO, MLCOM, MLOM, MLQM, and MLOE. 
Secondary events with event definitions that allow for the reassignment of an Event 
Key are not required to assign a new Event Key. In such cases, when reported, the 
Event Key must be equal to the related event from which the Secondary event 
originated. 
Simple Electronic 
Option Orders 
Orders to buy or sell a single option that are not related to or dependent on any other 
transaction for pricing or timing of execution that are either received or routed 
electronically by an Industry Member CAT Reporter.  
Electronic receipt of an order is defined as the initial receipt of an order by an 
Industry Member in electronic form in standard format directly into an order handling 
or execution system. Electronic routing of an order is the routing of an order via 
electronic medium in standard format from one Industry Member’s order handling or 
execution system to an exchange or another Industry Member. 
Trading Algorithm A computer program which receives an order and typically parameters for execution 
of that order. According to the parameters, which generally are time based/schedule 
based, and the purpose of the algorithm, the computer program determines the 
pricing and/or timing of execution and may generate “sub” or ”child” orders that are 
routed for execution to achieve the trading objective of the algorithm. Examples of 
Trade Algorithms include VWAP, TWAP, POV. Computer programs that simply 
determine the destination and quantity (such as a Smart Order Router), and which 
do not otherwise have discretion over price and/or timing are not considered a 
Trading Algorithm. 
Trade Date Trade Date for Industry Member is defined as beginning immediately after 
23:59:59.999999 ET on Trade Date T - 1 and up to 23:59:59.999999 ET of the next 
Trade Date T.  
Weekends and holidays are not considered a Trade Date. 
An event occurring on a weekend or holiday will be assigned to the next Trade Date.
